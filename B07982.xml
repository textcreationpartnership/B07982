            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL, SIR THOMAS VANE, Knight,</hi> Lieutenant of her Maieſties Caſtle of Douer, grace and peace in this life, and euerlasting felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the life to come.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T being my hap (right Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) to be abroad of late, more than vſuallie I am, it was alſo my chaunce to heare more than otherwiſe I knewe, (for mine owne part till then,
<pb facs="tcp:184271:4"/>
I did but knowe you <hi>ex facie.</hi>) And that which then I heard, it being ſpoken by ſome of good credit (if not great calling) em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened me to doe what now you ſee a dooing: for bethin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my ſelfe to whom I ſhould dedicate what your Worſhip ſees here following, that good report which I heard of you, both for ſinceritie in Religion, and integritie in conuerſation, made mee to reſolue my ſelfe vpon you. For well I knowe thoſe two good qualities would fit this ſimple peece of worke, made more for the profit of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, than the praiſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one. If I be too bolde with your Worſhip, hauing no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<pb facs="tcp:184271:4"/>
with you, pardon me of your pietie. Neither did I purpoſe to offend you willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, neither doe I thinke this way to hurt you haſtilie: If I bee no bolder than I may, take well in worth what is done, of your courteſie: neither is it vnfitting you to defend, what is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your patronage, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Knight; nor vnbeſeeming me to ſeeke your patrocinie, I being an inferior perſon. For the firſt, a ſworde was giuen you, for the ſecond, a tongue was giuen mee. As I vſe that now, ſo I pray you (if neede be) vſe you the other hereafter: as I haue heard, you haue done well in the field. As I wiſh, doe
<pb facs="tcp:184271:5"/>
alſo wel for the faith: that which I commend to your Patrocinie, (though I ſpeake not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it) is nothing I hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant therto. If it may pleaſe your Worſhip to deigne it the reading, you ſhall ſoone finde whether I falſifie or no. In labor (the prouerbe is) there is no loſſe. In this it may be there will be ſome gaine. If ſo, your good ſhall not be my griefe. I would what is done might benefit you, &amp; any: that I might haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the better hope, I commit it to your Worſhip to patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize. Oft the Patrone of the thing, workes good for the thing. Whatſoeuer your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip procures for this, account
<pb facs="tcp:184271:5"/>
it as purchaſed to your ſelfe. If it may proue any thing, &amp; worth any thing, I ſhall be nothing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, whoſoeuer elſe be ſomthing glad. If it will proue nothing, or as nothing, ſo your Worſhip be contented, I ſhalbe nothing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented. While that is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, whatſoeuer it be I wil make bold to leaue this which you ſee with you, and ſo humblie for this time take my leaue of you. The welſpring of all bleſſings ſo bleſſe your Wor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>whileſt you are here, as wel and euer bleſſed you may be when you goe hence.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian reader, I know not thy conceite: it may be good, it may bee bad, it may bee indifferent, if thou anſwerest ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the titles J haue giuen thee, it cannot be bad. Jf courteſie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not compell thee, yet Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may counſell thee to thinke and iudge the best; here is nothing done to the preiudice of any: if it pleaſe God to bleſſe, there may bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the benefite of many.
<pb facs="tcp:184271:7"/>
Though ſome others haue written of the ſame matter that J haue written of, yet that lets not but J may doe the like: as diuerſe Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may play vpon one instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo diuerſe men may write of one thing. J hope J haue iniured no man in writing. Jf I haue imitated any (as J denie not but J haue) J thinke in ſo doing, J haue rather honoured them than hurt them. For as J take it, it is an honour to be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitated. VVhatſoeuer it is that J haue done, I referre it to thy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian courteſie, or thy courteous Christianitie to iudge. Iudge I pray thee the best: my purpoſe was not to offend thee, bee not thou offended with me. VVhat is giuen thee with the right hand to doe good with,
<pb facs="tcp:184271:7"/>
take not thou with the left to doe hurt by: thou canst neuer heare too often of that thou maiest here reade of. Man is neuer ſo mindles of any thing, as of his owne death: for that cauſe God hath bidden thee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy end; ſome haue had thoſe that haue put them in minde of their end, and I haue collected this as thou ſeest to direct thee to thy end. As thou diſlikest not the marke that ſheweth thee thy way, though it goes not with thee in the way, ſo diſlike not of me for directing thee to death, though J go not with thee to death. <hi>Statutum eſt omnibus ſemel mori:</hi> It is appointed to all men to die once: and ſure I am that therefore once J muſt die. <hi>Certius nil morte:</hi> Nothing more ſure than
<pb facs="tcp:184271:8"/>
death. VVhether thou or I ſhall ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt tread the track to death, is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to either vnknowne. <hi>Neſcit homo finem ſuum:</hi> Man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his end. And as that ancient writer ſaith: <hi>Mortis hora incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius nihil:</hi> Than the houre of death nothing more vncertaine. Jf thou goeſt before me, <hi>ego te ſequar,</hi> J will, nay ſhall follow thee. Jf J goe before thee, aſsuredly thou canſt not deny, but that thou muſt follow me. That we may goe both well when we goe, God giue vs grace to prepare thereto, and for ere wee goe: though it bee the laſt to vs in action, yet it ought to be the firſt with vs in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. Firſt, becauſe it is certaine it will come. Secondly, becauſe it is vncertaine when it will come.
<pb facs="tcp:184271:8"/>
Thirdly, becauſe it is the greatest worke wee haue to doe when it doth come. Fourthly, becauſe there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothing but iudgement when it is come and gone. Js it euer amiſſe thinkeſt thou to be put in mind here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? If thou ſo thinkeſt, thou thinkeſt not right: the better ſhalt thou die, whenſoeuer thou doest die, if oft thou beeſt made to remember thou must die. Seldome doth he die well, that thinks not oft to die once: and euer dies he ill, that neuer thinkes to die at all. Jf not therefore for curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which thou wilt deigne many men, yet for Christianitie (which thou ſhouldest not denie any man) take it in gree, that thus J haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed thee. This if thou doest, J ſhall thinke my ſelfe beholding: if
<pb facs="tcp:184271:9"/>
not, J muſt and will bee contented with that which is aſſigned. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou handleſt me, God bleſſe thee whileſt thou readest, that thou maist be bleſſed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt read, and when thou remembrest, that ſo thou maiſt be too when thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest. And thus for this once J bid thee farewell in Christ.</p>

                  <hi>Be ye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo prepared therefore.</hi> Wherefore? <hi>Becauſe the ſonne of man will come at an houre when you thinke not.</hi> This giueth aſmuch as I ſeeke. For Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth aſwell at the particular Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a man (which is at his death) as at the generall, which ſhall be at the diſſolution. And yet you ſee his reaſon is from his comming at an houre when he is not thought of, be ye ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared: for the ſonne of man will come at an houre when ye think not. And thus ſayth Auguſtine. <hi>Thou knoweſt not in what houre he may come: Alwayes (therefore) watch, that ſo becauſe thou knoweſt not when he will come, he may finde thee prepared when hee ſhall come. It may be for this cauſe thou art ignorant, when he

                  <hi>To this ende our maker would haue our ende hidden, and the day of our death to be vnknowne, that whileſt it is alwaies vnknowne, it might alwaies bee thought to bee nigh at hand; and that euery man by ſo much might be the more feruent in working, by how much he is vncertaine of calling, that while we are vncertaine when we muſt dye, we might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies come prepared to death.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Brandmil. Con. fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebr.</note> To the like effect in like ſorte ſayth another.

               <p>
                  <hi>If men did foreknow when they ſhould dye, they would ſhew their diligence about that time, that they might not therefore be diligent onely in that time, but continually, he foreſheweth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a generall houre, nor a particular, that in alwaies looking for him, they might alwaies watch.</hi> For as Theophylacte well ſayth vpon the firſt chapter of the firſt of Pauls Epiſtles to the Theſſalonians.<note place="margin">Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact. in. 1. ap. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>If man knew his laſt day, he would indeuour himſelfe to doe any miſchiefe other dayes, then, the end of his life approaching

he would be baptized. Moreouer many if they knew they ſhould dye to morrow, would bethinke themſelues how many waies they might moleſt and afflict their aduerſaries, as though now they did deſpayre of themſelues, and did deſire to refreſh themſelues with their enemies bloud. Which thing is not now done for the feare of death ſtaying them, &amp; the loue &amp; deſire of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life recalling them.</hi> For the houre of death is alwaies vncertaine and vnknowne to thee.</p>
               <p>That thou mayſt feare, be feruent liue well, and flye euill. As though there were foure cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which moued God to make death vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: 1. Feare. 2. Loue. 3. Life. 4. Euill.

Touching the 4. ſaith the foreſaid writer. Therefore is the day of thy death vnknowne that thou maieſt eſchew many euilles which of the certaintie of death would enſue. For did men know they ſhould liue long, they would committe many euils, purpoſing afterwards to repent: but did they know they ſhould dye ſoone, they would liue ſo much the more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanelie, determining to haue ſome pleaſure ere they were for the preuenting of theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, the Lord hath made both death vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, and the time thereof vnknowne.

               <p>Yet it neither followeth thereupon, that a man may repent when he will, nor that his repentance is neuer too late if it comes.

               <p>The ſcripture therefore doth perſwade a man in the preſent time to prepare himſelfe to death, and not to delaye till the future, firſt becauſe the preſent time is certaine and ours: the future is vncertaine, and none of ours. For who can aſſure himſelfe of one day to liue, that hath alreadie many dayes liued? ſurely no man. As Seneca ſaith:<note place="margin">Seneca.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Luk. 12.40.</note> This alſo is the ſaying of Seneca, whom I mentioned euen now. <hi>Thou knoweſt not in what place death doth expect thee; therefore expect thou it in euery place. Sith man knowes not in what place death ought to meete him, hee knowes not in what place hee ought moſt to waite for death, in euery place it is to be expected.</hi> This therefore ſhould be eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans practiſe, he ſhould not delay to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for death: for this cauſe firſt, becauſe eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is vncertaine of his life. For as Salomon ſaith, <hi>Man knoweth not his ende, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.12.</note> Secondly becauſe it is good preſently to make prouiſion for the latter ende. For as Ieremie ſaith:<note place="margin">Lam. 3.27.</note> 
                  <hi>It is good for a man that hee bare the yoke in his youth. What liquor ſweete or ſowre the veſſell

                  <hi>A childe taught in the trade of his way, will not departe from it when he is olde.</hi> By ſo much hee liues the more ſecurely ſo long as he liues.<note place="margin">15.15.</note> For as Salomon ſaith: <hi>A good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.</hi> And thereupon Seneca ſaith. It is good before death to make the way thereto, and then to waite ſecurely for the other parte of the time. By ſo much he dyes the more bleſſedly when he dyes. For he dyes doubtfully that prouides not for death till he dyes. <hi>If any man in his laſt ſickenes will take vpon him to repent, and doth repent, and ſo departes hence, I confeſſe vnto you we denye him not what he deſireth; but we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not.</hi> Repentance we may giue him, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation wee cannot promiſe him. I ſay not that he ſhall be condemned, neither doe I ſay that he ſhall be ſaued. Wilt thou therefore be put cleane out of doubt? repent thee whileſt thou arte well. If thou doeſt ſo, I ſay thou arte ſafe, becauſe thou then repentedſt, when thou mighteſt haue ſinned. If thou wilt repent when thou canſt not ſinne, thy ſinnes haue forſaken thee, not thou them. Thirdly becauſe it is more difficult to do it heareafter than now: for then the hearte is more hardened, man is more weakened, ſinne is more ſtrengthened, and the diuell is more hardely remoued.

For ſinne he threw Lucifer from heauen: for ſinne he caſt Adam out of paradiſe: for ſinne he expelled Iudas from the ſocietie of his diſciples: thirdly, he ſpared not his owne ſonne, that he might be reuenged of ſinne.

Theſe offer not an immaculate lambe, but that I may ſo ſay, a curtaylde Swyne. For as an hogge hath lyne in the filthines, ſo hath an olde man in vices: and as an hogge is fed with huskes, ſo is an olde man delighted whih tales and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</hi> As Cyprian ſaith:<note place="margin">Cipri. de 12. abuſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus.</note> 
                  <hi>As there is not fruite founde on the tree, on which there hath not firſt appeared a bloſſome, ſo in olde age he cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne lawfull honour, which in youth hath not laboured in the exerciſe of ſome diſcipline.

I had forgotten my ſelfe, but I will remember you, and proceed. Sixtely, therefore he that taketh not time in time to prouide for his latter time, ſinneth againſt God becauſe he thence taketh occaſion to impugne him, whence he ſhould take occaſion to obey him. For of that hee lookes, that God will deale mercifullie with him, he determines to deale iniuriouſly with God.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4.</note> He purpoſes to offend him, <hi>As though he knew not, that the bountifulnes of God lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to repentance.

For ſinne againſt God hee cannot, but that in ſo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:184271:30"/>
ſinning he ſinneth alſo againſt them. As God goeth they goe. With whom hee is offended they are offended too. Againſt the Angels he ſinneth firſt, becauſe he defraudes them of the ioy they ſhould haue in his timely conuerſion and opportune prouiſion.<note place="margin">Luk. 15.10.</note> 
                  <hi>For there is ioy in the preſence of the Angels of God for one ſinner that conuerteth.</hi> But Salomon ſaith,<note place="margin">Prou. 13.12.</note>

Thirdly, againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he ſinneth, becauſe he will haue himſelfe rather euill than good; ſicke than ſound, dead than liuing; bond than free, in the eſtate of a theefe, than in the ſtate of a king; hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, than with the Church enioying all things.

Ioſua. 7. for the ſinne of Achan,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 7.4.</note> the people of Iſraell was puniſhed.

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.20.</note> 
                  <hi>not of it owne will, but by reaſon of him which hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued it vnder hope.</hi> For wee know that euery creature groaneth with vs alſo and trauaileth in payne togither vnto this preſent. In ſo much that euery of them in the day of iudgement may put vp his bill of complaynte againſt ſuch a driuing and delaying mate. And the Sunne may ſay, for his ſake I loſt my light; the moone, for his ſake I became darke; the Starres for his ſake we fell from heauen; the Earth for his ſake I became curſed; and brought forth thornes and thiſtles; the Aire, for his ſake I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came corrupt and breed plagues and peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the Water for his ſake I became polluted, and brought forth frogs euen in kings cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: all creatures; for his ſake we became re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, &amp; yeelded not that obedience, which, had not his ſinne been, wee both would and ſhould haue yeelded.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:184271:40"/>
Firſt, by the neceſſitie of death. 2. by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> practaſe of the godly. For firſt, neceſſarily a man muſt dy, and therefore dutifully he is to thinke of his death. For by ſo much he ſhall dye the better by how much he reſolues himſelfe to dye. The ſooner the expected death is the more bleſſed death. He ſeldome dyes happily, that dyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedly. 2. dutifully the godly haue prayed, that they might be reſolued to dy, and therefore careleſſely he is not to paſſe ouer his life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſerious meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of death. For what was not vnſeemely for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is not vnſightly for him. For death is more fitting any of vs now, than it was any of them then. For we liue to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our ſin, and to do no good; they liued to diminiſh their ſinne, and to do muh good. The glory of God, the benefit of his Church was the chiefe of their ſtudie, the offence of God and the hindrance of his church is not the leaſt of our practiſe. If therefore they laboured to be enabled to reſolue themſelues to dye, much more ſhould we; but for this they much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured; for for this they much prayed, Dauids prayer is to be ſeene Pſal. 39.4. Moſes his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is to be ſeene Pſal, 90. and 12. Tobits prayer is to bee ſeene Tob. 3. and 6. The firſt mans words were theſe:<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.4.</note>

                  <hi>Deale with me as ſeemeth beſt vnto thee, and commaund my ſpirit to bee taken from me, that I may be diſſolued, and become earth, for it is better for mee to dye than to liue.</hi> For this therefore ſhould we both labour and pray; a worke of nature it is not to bee prepared for death, but a worke of grace muſt proceed from God not from man. That which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from God, muſt by prayer be aſked of God. That man therefore may meditate of his death, he muſt craue grace of God to enable him to frame himſelfe to death, that ſo he may not altogether be vnprouided for death, and thus you ſee by what a man may be induced to thinke of his death, which is the firſt thing that he is to regarde in his life, that he be not taken vnawares by death.</p>

                  <hi>I would firſt know how many degrees of life eternall there are; for your naming of the firſt argues that there are diuers. I would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly learne what it is to enter into the firſt degree of eternall life. For you ſay he muſt ſtriue, and ſtriuing argues it is not common nor eaſie to enter into it. Thirdly, I would know by what meanes a man may come to enter thereinto. For enter a man cannot into any thing without meanes.</hi>

               <p>And theſe things in ſome ſorte will I manifeſt vnto you. Touching the firſt therfore, there are three degrees of life eternall. The firſt is in this life, when men being iuſtified and ſanctified haue peace with God. The ſecond is in the ende of life, when the body freed from all diſeaſes, paynes, and miſeries, is layd to reſt in the earth, and the ſoule is receiued into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. The third is after the daie of Iudgement, when bodie and ſoule being reunited ſhall be both aduanced to eternall glorie. Now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:184271:44"/>
into the firſt of theſe. 3. degrees of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, is to haue ſuch peace with God through Chriſt, as he that hath it, can ſay with Paul, <hi>I liue not, but Chriſt liues in me.</hi> The meanes to enter heereinto are three. Repentance of ſin, Fayth in Chriſt and Newenes of life. For none can enter heereinto, but he that repents him of his ſinnes, beleeues in Chriſt and riſeth to newenes of life. He that repents not, periſheth; He that beleeueth not is condemned; He that walketh not in newnes of life, is yet in his ſinnes. Hence it is, that Peter ſaid vnto the Iewes; <hi>A mende your liues and turne, that your ſinnes may be put away when the time of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 3.19.</note> Hence is it that Paul ſaid vnto the Iayler,<note place="margin">16 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaued and thine houſehold.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 4.24,</note> Hence is it that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel ſaid to Nebuchadnezar. <hi>Breake off thy ſinnes by righteouſnes, and thine iniquities by mercie toward the poore. Loe let there be an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of thine errour.</hi> Hence it is that as Peter ſaid of <hi>Ioyning vertue with faith and with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue knowledge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.5.</note> 
                  <hi>and with knowledge temperance, and with temperance patience: and with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence godlines, and with godlines brotherly kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and with brotherly kindenes loue: if ye doe theſe things ye ſhall neuer fall.</hi> So may I ſay of mixing repentance with faith; and with faith obedience, and with obedience, more: if ye
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:184271:44"/>
doe theſe things, ye ſhall neuer fall, for as Iohn the Euangeliſt ſayth:<note place="margin">Apoc. 20.6.</note>

               <p>Hee muſt inure himſelfe by little and little to die before euer hee comes in deede to die. For the more a man in health inures him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to die, the leſſe vnwilling in ſickenes hee ſhalbe to die, for death after affliction is leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than before, hence is it that Paule ſaith in his firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>By the reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing which I haue in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord I die dayly,</hi> dayly, becauſe he was often in danger of death, by reaſon of his calling, and dayly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in all his dangers he inured himſelfe to die: from this example ſhould all that woulde
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:184271:46"/>
well die, learne dayly to die, this dayly dying is the right way to well dying, for he that dies dayly, when he dyes, dyes happily, hee neuer puts death farre from him; hee neuer makes death a ſtranger to him; he neuer thinks death altogether againſt him, oh that men would more inure themſelues to die? then woulde they be more religious, and leſſe ſuperſtitious; more vertuous and leſſe vitious; more boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and leſſe couetous, more appliable to good, and leſſe inclinable to euill, and to ſay at once, then would they haue leſſer affection to liue, and greater delight and deſire to dye, their not acquainting themſelues with death, makes them ſeldome when well prepared for death. Of another minde than many, and of a better then was that good man, and Martyr, the Martir Bilney in the daies of Queene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: for he to the ende he might well ſuffer, did often ere hee ſuffered, inure himſelfe to ſuffer; oft before he was burned did he put his finger into the flame of a candle, not onely to make tryal of his ability in ſuffering, but alſo to arme himſelfe againſt greater torments in death, Of the like minde before death ſhould others bee in life, that ſo they might neuer be vnprouided againſt death.</p>

               <p>What you wiſhe I will; for it is not good to haue a man vnprepared for death at any time, when death is nigheſt, no man knowes. The prouerbe is, when health is higheſt death is nigheſt, and the trueth is: It is nigher to vs in ſicknes then in health. Then wee ſee thoſe ſignes thereof, which in health we neither nor can ſee. But when indeede it is nigheſt to any, God onely knowes, who hath the keyes of life and death in his hand for many we ſee dy ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly in health, as ſome we know dy lingring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſicknes. In ſicknes death ſheweth it ſelfe to be nigher; but when it is nigheſt it doth not alwayes ſhewe. To be alwayes therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for death is the beſt medicine againſt death: but becauſe that either euer is not, or

euer will not be I will to the queſtion you haue propounded as faſt as may be, that in ſicknes therefore a man may rightly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe to dy in ſicknes three ſortes of duties he duely is to looke vnto.

               <p>Theſe which heere follow. Firſt he muſt make a new examination of his life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, according as the Iſraelites did, when in their affliction they ſaid,<note place="margin">Lam. 3.40.</note> 
                  <hi>Let vs ſearch and try our wayes, and turne againe vnto the Lord.</hi> Secondly, he muſt make a new confeſſion vnto God of his new and particular ſinnes,<note place="margin">Iam. 5.16.</note> as God ſendes new corrections and chaſticements: ſo
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:184271:53"/>
did Dauid when he had the hand of God very heauie vpon him for his ſinnes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.5.</note> ſo as his very bones and moyſture conſumed within him, and therupon obteyned he his pardon, and was healed. Thirdly he muſt make new prayer and more earneſt than euer before, with ſighes and groanes of the ſpirit, for pardon of the ſame ſinnes, and for reconciliation with God in Chriſt; thus did king Dauid in his ſickenes. For he made certaine pſalmes either when he was ſicke, or elſe after he had been ſicke. As namely the ſixt, the two and thirtie, the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie eight, the thirtie nine; all which are pſalmes of repentance, pſalmes wherein vpon diſtreſſe of body and mind, he renued his faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, bewayling his ſinnes, and intreating the Lord for pardon of them. Thus alſo did Hezekiah in his ſickenes.<note place="margin">Eſa. 38.</note> For when he lay ſicke as he thought (and as the Prophet told him) vpon his Deathbed, he wept as for ſome other cauſes, ſo alſo for his ſinnes, and withall he prayed vnto God to caſt them behinde his backe. Thus alſo in his ſickenes ſhould he doe that is ſicke: for as Iames asked the queſtion, is any man afflicted? ſo if there be,<note place="margin">Iam. 5.13.</note> he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth (ſhewing him his dutie) let him pray and in prayer what ſhall he aske, but the free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and full remiſſion of all his ſinnes? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith Dauid, wherefore?<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.6.</note> for the remiſſion of his ſinnes ſhall euery one that is godly make
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:184271:54"/>
his prayer vnto thee in a time when thou mayeſt be found, that is in the time of tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the Lord is nigh vnto thoſe that are of a broken heart, and a troubled ſpirit. Yea the Lord is with them that are in tribulation, and makes all their bed in their ſickenes. In that forme of prayer which Chriſt hath deliuered vnto vs, one of the mayneſt petitions is, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs our treſpaſſes, as though the heart of our prayers ſhould be the forgiuenes of our ſinnes. For that petition is placed euen in the hearte of that our prayer, to ſignifie what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition ſhould euerly vpon our hearts. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that is ſicke muſt pray in ſeeking to be reconciled vnto God, ſo in praying he muſt aske the pardon and forgiuenes of his ſinnes. For in the remiſſion of his ſins conſiſteth the ſaluation of his ſoule.</p>

Now for the fourth in the fourth place he muſt by all meanes auoyde all thoſe ſinnes which incenſe his God to wrath,<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.14.

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.14.</note> The ſame ſaying muſt the ſicke take as ſpoken to himſelfe.

               <p>To the purpoſe intended then may the conſideration of the firſt of the fower well ſerue: for conſider he himſelfe that is ſick, and he ſhall finde that his body is but a priſon to his ſoule, and his ſoule a priſoner in his body.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:184271:63"/>
And why ſhould not this arme him againſt all immoderate feare of death? for what ſhould he feare the breaking of his priſon, &amp; the freeing of his priſoner? Dauid deſirous of life eternall, and the ſight of his maſter cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>Oh how long ſhall I liue in this priſon?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 142.7.</note> And Paul reuoluing with himſelfe the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that infeſted him in this priſon, cryed out,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> 
                  <hi>Oh wretch that I am who ſhall deliuer me from this body of ſinne?</hi> Dauid and Pauls practiſe ſhould be the ſickemans preſident. His body to him is no better then Pauls and Dauids body was to them. His body therefore is but a body of ſinne, a priſon of the ſoule, a burthen to the minde and ſpirit. As a man of God hath ſaid, no bocardo, no dungeon, no ſinke, no puddle, no pit is in any reſpect ſo euill a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the body, as the body is of the ſoule. For it is ſuch a cage as ſtinketh in the ſight of God; a body of ſinne is this cage of the ſoule. And therefore he that is ſicke ſhould feare no more to goe out of it, than out of a priſon. To feare the deliuery of the ſoule from priſon is meere folly. It is to wiſh a ſtinking lodging, and a filthy cage to dwell in, and euer to cary it about which is extreame miſery. It is to wiſh continuall baniſhment from the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full realme of heauen, his naturall country, which is extreame madnes. What man would be ſo fooliſh, wretched, careles &amp; mad, as to

wiſh any ſuch matter? none wiſe, ſober, and in his right witts. The ſicke therefore vnles he will be counted fooliſh, wretched, careles and mad, muſt neuer feare immoderately the opening of his priſon, and the looſening of his priſoner. Now if the conſideration of this firſt practiſe doth thus well ſerue to the fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the ſoule againſt al immoderate feare of death, what ſhall wee thinke any of the reſt that follow to bee of much leſſe value. Truly no. For going from the conſideration of himſelfe to the conſideration of his life, ſhall he there finde any leſſe force than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?<note place="margin">Iam. 4.14.</note> ſurely no? for what is his life? <hi>It is but a vapour that appeareth for a little time, &amp; then vaniſheth away,</hi> What is the certaintie that he hath either of it or in it? it is a meere vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie.<note place="margin">Syr. 18. 8.</note> For as Syrach ſaith, <hi>No man hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge of his death.</hi> His life is like the weathercocke which turneth at euery blaſt, the waue which mounteth at euery ſtorme; the reed which boweth at euery winde: but his death is like a theefe which commeth at vnwares. What is the peace hee hath all his daies? little or none. His life is but a warfare full of continuall labour and ſorrow. And now what ſhould he feare inordinarily, the vaniſhing of a vapour, the turning of a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thercocke the breaking vp of a warfare? the Saints in the Apocalips ſay,<note place="margin">Apoc. 22.20.</note>

It is the law of nations that thou muſt reſtore againe what thou haſt receiued. Againe; thou ſhalt dye. (What then?) thy life is but a pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.

                  <hi>It hurts not thoſe which are good, whether they be murthered, or taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by ſodaine death.

               <p>Euen aſmuch as I would deſire, and more then ſo much as you did require. For what did I deſire, or you require, but to know what God did in euerie mans Death? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he determined of the time, or not? and whether he fore-knew what he had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? And now whether of theſe is it, which is not here manifeſted and explained? the firſt or the laſt? ſurelie, ſurelie, neither of both. Not the firſt, becauſe he determined the time of Chriſts death, and what agreed to the head, agreeth with the parts, but Chriſt is the head, and thoſe of the Church are his members. If therefore the Death of Chriſt (the head to the whole bodie) were fore-ſeene (as fore-ſeene it was) the Death alſo of euerie member of his myſticall bodie is alſo fore ſeene, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined alſo by the ſpeciall decree and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God. Neyther yet the ſeconde, becauſe he determined not onelie the time, but alſo the place and manner, and ende of Chriſts death, togither with other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereto appertaining and belonging, and he determines nothing which he did not fore-knowe, for his fore-knowledge is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned with his decree. If therefore he ſo dealt with Chriſt, it cannot be, but that ſo alſo hee dealeth with others: for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Thoſe which he knew before,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.29.</note> 
                  <hi>he alſo predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be made like to the Image of his Sonne.</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:184271:75"/>
Thus now you ſee that the Death of Chriſt is aſmuch to the Death of all men, as either I deſired, or you required.</p>

               <p>What elſe? for firſt, there is none die in the Lord but they which haue liued in the Lord
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:184271:78"/>
for liuing ſometime in the Lord, muſt goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dying any time in the Lord: for as Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine ſaith: <hi>He hardly dies wel, which alwaies li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ill.</hi> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, they which ſo dy, are ſaid to be bleſſed: bleſſed are they which dy in the Lord. Thirdly, that bleſſing then beginneth, when as this life endeth. For it is ſaid; therefore they are bleſſed which die in the Lord, becauſe they reſt from their labours, &amp; their workes follow them. In which words there is both an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the time wherein they are bleſſed, and alſo of the cauſe wherefore they are bleſſed. The time is the time of their death: for it is ſaid, bleſſed are they which die in the Lord. The cauſe is their reſting from their labour. For bleſſed are they which die in the Lord, for they reſt from their labours, &amp;c. In both the Euangeliſt ſpeakes in the preſent tenſe, hauing an eie in the laſt to the preterperfect. For firſt he ſaith, they are bleſſed: he ſaith not that either they were bleſſed in the time paſt, or they ſhall be bleſſed in the time to come: but they are bleſſed in the time preſent, as though they were in bliſſe, euen in their death. Secondly, he ſaith they doe reſt, he ſaith not, that they haue reſted, or that they ſhall reſt, but that they doe reſt, as though their death were a reſt, and not a diſtreſſe. Thirdly, he ſaith from their labours: as though death preſent were a reſt from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours paſt.</p>

                  <hi>Though the Euangeliſt ſaith ſo; yet it followeth not but that they which dy in the Lord, both were bleſſed, and did reſt before their death, and ſhall be bleſſed, and reſt better after their death?</hi>

               <p>Neither did I yet ſay, that any ſuch thing will thereupon follow. For the moſt of thoſe that at their death are bleſſed, in their life alſo were in ſome ſorte bleſſed: and all thoſe that are bleſſed in their death, ſhall for euer after be bleſſed after death. Eternall life is heere in this life begunne, and that ſometime long before death, and ſometime in death; but it is neuer finiſhed or perfected till the life to come, and after death. There is perfection, heere is but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coation; there life is perfected, heere it is but incepted. He which heere hath it not, at any time there enioyes it not. On the contrarie part, he which heere is entred into it, ſhall there ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be poſſeſſed of it. To conclude therfore, they which are bleſſed in their death, were alſo bleſſed in their life, and ſhall be bleſſed after death with life laſting euer, and enduring world without end.</p>

               <p>It followeth not vpon either of your reaſons, that it is vnneceſſarie. For firſt, that which feweſt follow, is moſt neceſſarie: The preaching of the word of God feweſt regard; yet is the attending thereto moſt neceſſarie. When Martha being offended with her ſiſter Marie, for that ſhee would not helpe her to ſerue when ſhe gaue entertainement to Chriſt, but ſate ſtill at Ieſus his feete, attending to what he ſpeake, complayned to Ieſus, that her ſiſter left her alone to ſerue; Ieſus himſelfe was ſo farre from reproouing of Marie for this her fact, as he defended her and reprooued Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,<note place="margin">Luk. 10.41.</note> ſaying. <hi>Martha, Martha, thou careſt, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:184271:80"/>
art troubled about many things. But one thing is needefull. Marie hath choſen the good part which ſhall not bee taken from her.</hi> Thereby ſhewing that the hearing of the word preached was neceſſarie, and more neceſſarie than the corporall entertaining of him. Secondly, that which is by Iohn the Euangeliſt ſaid, is not ſo to bee vnderſtood, as men neede not care to liue well, becauſe there by him it is ſaid, that they are bleſſed which die in the Lord. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept while they liue, they liue to the Lord, when they die, they cannot die in the Lord. Liuing to the Lord is a meane to come to die in the Lord.

               <p>What more manifeſt? for what is it to liue to the Lord, but to liue according to the will of the Lord? and he that thus liued ere he died, as you haue heard, how did he not liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of the Lord? in three things doth the will of the Lord conſiſt. 1. In this, that a man turnes from his wicked waies, to him.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:184271:84"/>
For as by his prophet Ezekiel he ſaith.<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.23</note> 
                  <hi>Is it my will that the wicked ſhould die, ſaith the Lord God, or rather that hee may returne from his waies and liue? As I liue ſaith the Lord God; I will not or I deſire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way, and liue.</hi> 2. In this that a man exerciſes himſelfe in liuing godlily. For by his bleſſed Apoſtle he ſaith.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.15.</note> 
                  <hi>So is the will of God, that by well doing ye may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men.</hi> 3. In this that a man continues in well doing to his liues end. For ſaith the beloued Sonne of God:<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.39.</note> 
                  <hi>This is the fathers will that hath ſent me, that of all which he hath giuen me, I ſhould looſe nothing.</hi> Now perſeuerance in doing good is that which makes that a man is not loſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſaid:<note place="margin">Mat. 10.22.</note> 
                  <hi>He that endureth to the end, he ſhall be ſaued.</hi> Saith Hierome: <hi>It is not the point of vertue to haue begunne, but to haue continued and perfected what was begunne.</hi> And ſaith Remigius: <hi>Rewarde is giuen not to thoſe that beginne, but to thoſe that perſeuer.</hi> For as Iſidore ſaith: <hi>Then doth our conuerſation pleaſe God, when we finiſh the good which we beginne by holding out to the ende.</hi> In which of theſe three did not he we ſpeake of, according to the will of the Lord? in the firſt, the ſecond, or the third in neither. Not in the firſt, for there he turned from his wicked waies; he had been a theefe, now he was none; he had been an euill
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:184271:84"/>
doer, now he was none; he had been a reuiler of the ſonne of God; now he was none. Not in the ſecond; for there after that once he was conuerted, he exerciſed himſelfe in doing of good. He ſorowed for his ſinnes, he confeſſed them, he prayed for pardon of them, he ſuffered quietly ſome puniſhment due to them he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued his fellow theefe for continuing in them, he iuſtified Chriſt the Meſſias from the guiltines either of them or the like vnto them. the text which recordes the hiſtorie of him prooues aſmuch as I ſay. One of the euill doers which were hanged, railed on Chriſt Ieſus, ſaying.<note place="margin">Luk. 23.39.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou be the Chriſt ſaue thy ſelfe and vs. But the other aunſwered and rebuked him ſaying, feareſt thou not God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation?</hi> There is a ſhew of his owne conuerſion, &amp; his fellowes corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>We are indeede righteouſly heere;</hi> There is his confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with a continuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his fellowes corruption. <hi>For we receiue things worthie of that we haue done:</hi> There is his patient ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of puniſhment, with a reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his fellowes corruption.

Neither yet in the third, for there he

perſeuered as long as life laſted. After once he put his hand to the plough, he neuer look't backe. In what hee ſometime ere his death liued, in that he once at the ende of his life died. In faith, and hope, and loue, he liued, for the time after his conuerſion that he liued, and in faith hope and loue hee died, when the time wa, this life ended. In aſmuch then, as in his life from his conuerſion to his death he liued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of the Lord, it is thereby certaine, that ere he once died in the Lord, he ſometime liued to the Lord. And ſo at length that is manifeſted, which long I haue laboured to manifeſt.</p>

               <p>Without cauſe if you be. For the truth thereof it is this: he that dyeth beleeuing in Chriſt, dyeth not out of Chriſt, but in Chriſt. For he which beleeueth in Chriſt, is in Chriſt, &amp; he that is in Chriſt, by beleeuing in Chriſt,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:184271:87"/>
hath both his bodie and ſoule really coupled to Chriſt, according to the tenour of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of Grace, ſo that though after Death body and ſoule be ſeuered one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet neither of them are ſeuered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned from Chriſt. For the coniunction which is once begunne in this life remaines for euer in the life to come, and he that is thus conioyned to Chriſt, what needs he doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing touching the effect of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction? what neede hee immoderately or inordinately feare Death.

               <p>By meanes many. In number three, Firſt by moderating and leſſening the paines and torments of ſickenes and death, as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie words of his promiſe by Eſaie his Prophet doe plainelie import. For he ſaith,<note place="margin">Iſai. 43.3.</note> 
                  <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will bee with thee, that the flouds doe not ouerflow thee, and when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle vpon thee,</hi> So that if the flouds do not ouerflow a man when he is in the waters, nor the flame kindle vpon him when he is in the fire, hee may well thinke the Lord is there preſent, reſtraining both the waters from ſwelling, and the fire from burning. For naturally either of them would do the kind, if he did not reſtraine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo in the paines of ſicknes, &amp; pangs of death, if a man findes his ſorrowes nothing ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:184271:90"/>
as the afflictions of his life, he may well thinke the Lord preſent, for the paines of the one, and the pangs of the other are painefull ynough of themſelues, and ouermuch yrke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to many. Yet this that I now ſay, many haue true indeed found, of many ſuch there is mention made in the Acts &amp; Monuments of the Church, they which haue the booke may looke into it, aſſuredly they ſhall finde what I heare ſay: neither ſhall they looſe their time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue ſo done, or repent them of their labour in ſo doing. For my part I muſt now proceed from this meanes of the Lords, manifeſting his preſence (though he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, and not to bee ſeene viſibly) to the next. Secondly therefore the Lord doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his preſence in the paines of ſickenes and pangs of death, by giuing in inward and vnſpeakable comfort of his ſpirit vnto them that are afflicted with the one, and diſtreſſed with the other, for to many then doth he giue a greater portion of his ſpirit, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times bypaſt and foregone. In one place of ſcripture the Apoſtle Paul ſpeaking of himſelfe and his afflictions ſaith thus: <hi>As the ſuffering of Chriſt abounded in vs, ſo our conſolation aboundeth through Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 15.</note> And in another place ſpeaking of his owne and his fellowes behauiour in their tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hee ſaith thus: <hi>Wee reioyce in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:184271:90"/>
knowing that tribulation bringeth forth patience, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.3.</note> Now there muſt bee ſome thing that muſt worke this ioye and comfort. For as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith:<note place="margin">Heb. 12.11.</note> 
                  <hi>No chaſtiſing for the preſent time ſeemeth to be ioyous, but grieuous.</hi> And what muſt that be, but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God? for a fruite of the ſpirit,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, is ioy, yea ioy in tribulation and affliction, as ſeemeth by the fruits of the ſpirit thereto annexed: for after ioy followeth peace, long ſuffering, gentlenes, goodnes, faith, and meekenes: all which are vertues more to be practiſed in tribulation, than any other time. When the Apoſtle therefore will expreſſe the cauſe of all this ioy and reioycing in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe the loue of God is ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt, which is giuen vnto vs.</hi> Thereby ſhewing, that the holy Ghoſt (which is God) is cauſe of all this ioy. And therefore not abſent from him or them, in whom this ioy is. For as he ſaith,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.17</note> 
                  <hi>Where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is libertie:</hi> So may I ſay, where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is ioy. And where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there the Lord himſelfe is: <hi>For the Lord is the ſpirit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.17.</note> So that by this ioy <hi>vz.</hi> inward ioy in greefe, and vnſpeakable reioycing in tribulation, a man may gather that the Lord doth then viſit him as it were in his owne perſon and miniſter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him refreſhing for his ſoule: hence is it, that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:184271:91"/>
the Church ſaith in the Canticles.<note place="margin">Cant. 2.5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>She being ſicke of loue: his left hand is vnder mine head, and his right hand doth embrace me.</hi> And the Prophet Dauid in his Pſalmes of him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wiſely of the poore:<note place="margin">Pſal. 41.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed is hee that iudgeth wiſely of the poore: the Lord ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him in the time of trouble; the Lord will keepe him and preſerue him aliue. The Lord will ſtrengthen him vpon the bed of ſorrow, thou haſt turned all his bed in his ſickenes.</hi> What thence ſhould follow, ſhall hereafter follow: for now the third meanes thereby the Lord doth ſhew himſelfe preſent in ſickenes and death is to follow. And that is the miniſterie of good Angels. For then doth the Lord ſend them to his ſeruants, as nources and keepers, to holde and beare them in their armes. For as the Apoſtle ſaith:<note place="margin">Heb. 1.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for their ſakes, which ſhall be heires of ſaluation?</hi> And as the Pſalmiſt ſaith:<note place="margin">Pſalm. 34.7.</note> 
                  <hi>The Angell of the Lord pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth round about them that feare him; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth them.</hi> And againe; hee (that is the Lord) <hi>Shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee to keepe thee in all thy wayes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 91.11.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall boare thee in their hands, that thou hurte not thy foote againſt a ſtone.</hi> So much ſundry hiſtories of ſcripture doe manifeſt, if of it ſelfe it were not manifeſt. When Hagar Abrahams bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman ſaid touching her ſonne Iſmael, <hi>I will

               <p>It is ſo in regarde of time, but not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of meanes. For the cluſter of figges was a naturall and ordinarie medicine or plaiſter ſeruing to ſoften and ripen tumours of ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the fleſh.<note place="margin">Gal. lib. 2. de art. cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiua. c. 1.</note> And though that had been, yet would not therefore the vſe of phiſicke come to bee deſpiſed and contemned.

And therefore phyſicke ought not to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For that ſurely is not to be condemned, for which a man in ſcripture is highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. For it is a good thing that workes commendation.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.3.</note> Wilt thou be without feare of the power ſaith the Apoſtle? doe well then: ſo ſhalt thou haue praiſe of the ſame. But the Samaritane as I ſay, was therefore commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

How now can men deſpiſe the vſe of theſe things, but that they therewith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deſpiſe the further enioyall of their health, which by theſe things is to be repayred, being by ſome of their things decayed? and this to doe, what other thing is it, than to be guiltie of their owne blouds in the preſence of the Lord Iehouah the mightie Lord of hoſts? for to neglect the meanes to health, what other thing is it but to depriue themſelues of life? and what is it to depriue themſelues of life, but to be guiltie of their owne blouds? to ſay

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:184271:99"/>
vſe reaſon in his doings? his will is reaſon enough. For he knoweth whereof wee ſtand in neede: and of the firſt our owne neede is one good reaſon. For Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, <hi>The whole haue no neede of the phyſician,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 9.13.</note> 
                  <hi>but the ſicke haue.</hi> Another is the Lords ordeyning of the phyſicke. For as Syrach ſaith, <hi>The Lord hath created medicines of the earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Syr. 38. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and he that is wiſe will not abhorre them.</hi> A third is the multiplicitie of cures that haue been done by it.<note place="margin">Exod. 15.25</note> Was not the water made ſweet with woode, that men might know the vertue thereof? was not Hezekiah his bile healed with a cluſter of figges, that men might know the operation of them? with ſuch things doth the Lorde heale men, and take away their paines. The varietie of tables wherein were written the cures that were done by it, which was found by hypocrites in the temple of Diana at Epheſus, can giue witnes to this I ſay. So can alſo the particular relation of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie others, who through phyſicke haue been freed from thoſe miſeries, with which ſome long time before they had bin perplexed: but my purpoſe it is not to proſecute theſe things. A fourth reaſon of that I ſay, is mans neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie; for man cannot well be without phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke: for now his head akes, now his heart grieues, now his liuer heates, now his ſtomach cooles, now his ſplene ſwelles, now his reines
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:184271:99"/>
grindes, now his ſight failes him, now his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring goes from him, &amp;c. But for all theſe and many moe phyſicke helpes him with remedy. And therefore not without reaſon hath the Lord commaunded phyſicke to be vſed. To proceede, where he had ſuch reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund phyſicke to be vſed, we cannot thinke he wanted reaſon to commaund the phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be honoured. For, for the firſt is the laſt; ſo that whereſoeuer the firſt is to be vſed, the ſecond is to be regarded. But you ſay why and wherefore? and I aunſwer. Firſt,<note place="margin">Syr. 38. 1. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe the Lord hath created him.</hi> Syrach 38. ver. 1. and ver. 12. And ſaith Paul.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.4. Syr. 38.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Euery creature of God is good, and nothing ought to be refuſed.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe man himſelfe hath neede of him. And much is that to be eſteemed, which much is needed. Thirdly, becauſe the houre may come, wherein their enterpriſes ſhall haue good ſucceſſe. And that that may doe good at any time, is to be deſpiſed at no time. Fourthly, becauſe in the ſight of great men he is had in admiration, &amp; that which great men eſteeme, meane men ſhould not deſpiſe. The prouerbe is, and with it the truth, like prince like people. Such as the maſter of the houſe is, ſuch ſoone will thoſe of the houſehold be. But princes and great men greatly honour the phyſitian. Ptolemeus ſonne to Antiochus the firſt, gaue vnto Ariſtrato, coſin to the great
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:184271:100"/>
Philoſopher Ariſtotle, a thouſand talents of ſiluer, and a cup of golde, in ſuch wiſe that he wan honour throughout all Aſia, and riches for his houſe, and all for curing Antiochus his father of a certaine diſeaſe of the lights. The Romans did erect vnto Antony Muſa, by birth a Grecian, and by profeſſion a phyſician, a picture of Porphyrie in the fielde of Mars, and alſo gaue him priuiledge of citizen of Rome, and all becauſe he cured their Emperour Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus of a ſciatica that he had in his thigh. To ſpeake of mo is needeles, when to theſe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience herſelfe giues further witnes. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is, no meane man ought to deſpiſe the phyſitian. The meane mans health ought to be as deare to him, as the great mans is. It coſt God aſmuch to giue him life, as it did to giue life to the mightieſt monarch in the world. And as carefull ought he to be of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing life in himſelfe, as the great man is of maintaining life in himſelfe: life either is or ought to be alike ſweete to all.</p>

               <p>Yet therein may you ſee, what I would haue you ſee. See viz.

The firſt in the two firſt you ſee: for there as Ahaziah ſinned, ſo he was therefore reproued, The ſecond in the laſt, you ſay you ſee, for there is ſhewed how A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haziah ſhould ſpeed, for his wicked deed.</p>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:184271:109"/>
ſunne: but by phyſicke, a man full bodied, taken with a pleuriſie, the Moone being in Leo muſt preſently be let bloud, or elſe it will goe hard with him: for if he ſtay till the Moone be remoued out of Leo, he may by all likelyhoode die, either by inflammation of the bloud, or by conſumption of the lungs. For in the time the Moone makes her abode in Leo, the apoſteme increaſes ſo much by the gathering togither of the humours, as it can neither be diſſolued nor ripened. Through the defect of either of which it comes to paſſe, that either the bloud is inflamed, or the lungs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed: of which two whether ſoeuer betides, the life will ſoone be ſhortened. But to leaue this, and learne more, by aſtrologie againe, a man muſt not be let bloud, the Moone being in malignant aſpects with any of the vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat planets: but by phyſicke,<note place="margin">Lang. lib. 1. epiſt. 35.

               <p>And I will. Firſt, in defect of ſuch as
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:184271:110"/>
are to put the ſicke in minde of their ſinnes, they are to aduertiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are their patients to humble themſelues truely vnder the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hand of God, and feruently to pray vnto him in the name of Chriſt, for the free and full pardon of all their ſinnes. This is as it were a preparatiue to the phiſicke they ſhall giue. This if they do ere euer they miniſter any phyſicke, it will cauſe their worke to haue the better ſucceſſe. For oftentimes the impenitencie of the ſicke is an hindrance to the phyſitions. It cauſeth that the phyſicke by them giuen will not worke, either as in reaſon it ſhould, or by hope they expect it would. Secondly, after they haue miniſtred any phyſicke, they are to pray vnto almightie God, that he in mercie would vouchſafe to giue thereto happie and proſperous ſucceſſe, for as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Except the Lorde doth builde the houſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 127.1.</note> 
                  <hi>they labour in vaine that build it, except the Lord keepeth the citie, the keeper watcheth in vaine:</hi> So heere may I ſay, except the Lorde doth bleſſe the Phyſicke the phyſitions doe giue it in vaine. If they any thing doubte whether this duetie doth ly vpon themor no, they may conſult with Ieſus the ſonne of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach touching it, and he will teach it then out of doubt. Theſe are his wordes; <hi>They alſo ſhall pray vnto the Lord, that he would proſper that, which is giuen for eaſe, and their phyſicke
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:184271:111"/>
for the prolonging of life.</hi> And I thinke they giue aſmuch, as I either aske or ſeeke. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they doe or no, I will not ſpend either more time, or further labour in proouing of it. For they will readily graunt it without gaine ſaying if they be as they ſhould be. For why? it is the part of the Godly man at euery turne to pray; and one thing that he is to pray for, is that God would bleſſe him in his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and giue ſucceſſe to that he takes in hand.<note place="margin">Dan. 6.10. Pſalm. 109.164. Rom. 1.9.10.2. 1. Theſ. 5.17.</note> Daniel ſaith that hee prayed thriſe a day. Dauid ſaith, that he prayed ſeuen times a day. Paul ſaith, that hee prayed without ceaſing.

And he that prayed himſelfe without ceaſing, and taught others to doe the like, prayed alſo that by ſome meanes one time or other he might haue a proſperous iourney by the will of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.9.</note> thereby teaching what others in the like caſes are to doe. But I will not ſtand vpon this. It is apparant enough of it ſelfe, that as they are to pray ere they giue, that they may giue, ſo they are to doe when they haue giuen, that good may be done by that which is giuen: that ſo they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the bleſſing by giuing to be Gods, aſwell as they doe the power to giue.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:184271:111"/>
giuing they ſee any certaine and manifeſt ſignes of death in the ſicke, they are to certifie their patients thereof, and to tell them plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in what perill they are. For this, as it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue the ſicke of all confidence in earthly thinges (as thoſe thinges which are vaine and tranſitorie:) ſo will it make them to put all their affiance in the meere mercie of God, as the ſafe and ſure anchor of their ſoules. For as once the Apoſtle ſaid of himſelfe and his like,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.9.</note>

               <p>His being a prophet hinders not, but they may learne of him aſmuch as I ſay.

I ſee not but I may alſo ſay he plaid both in the firſt, becauſe he might aſwel ſay, as a phiſition, ſet thy houſe in order, for thou muſt die, as a Prophet. For as it is not the Prophets part alone to moue men to make their willes; but others may do it aſwell as they; ſo is it not the phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons part alone, to tell men they ſhall die, but others may doe it aſwell as they.

And for the contempt thereof amongſt vs, much woe by ſome is ſuſtained. For thence it often comes, that thoſe diſeaſes proue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable which are of themſelues curable, and they that are moleſted with them, ſodainly die of them, who otherwiſe in mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might haue liued long without them. Ere euer therefore any phiſicke be taken by the ſicke, it is good that as the Lord doth hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him by ſickenes, ſo he doth humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto God for all his ſinnes, and craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of them: ſo ſhall both his phiſicke be bleſſed vnto him, and he himſelfe bleſſed in the vſe of it. But till hee be reconciled vnto God, by his humbling of himſelfe, and crauing pardon of him, twentie to one his phiſicke will neuer doe him good. <hi>For as vnto the pure all things are pure, ſo vnto them that are defiled,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> 
                  <hi>and vnbeleeuing nothing is pure, but euen their mindes and conſciences are defiled.</hi> But to leaue this firſt, with which he that is ſicke, is to take phiſicke, I wil come to the ſecond, with which he is to take vſe of phiſicke, as with the firſt. Touching which I ſay that with it he is to take phiſicke, becauſe that when he hath prepared himſelfe, and is about to take phiſicke, he muſt ſanctifie the phiſicke which he takes, by the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:184271:114"/>
worde of God and by prayer, as he doth any of his other either meates or drinkes. That by the firſt. <hi>i.</hi> the worde, he may haue warrant that the preſcribed medicines which he is to take be lawfull and good, and by the. 2. that is praier, he may haue Gods bleſſing vpon the ſame to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> recouering of his health if it be Gods good wil and pleaſure. For as without the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the word nothing is lawful, ſo without the vſe of praier nothing is ſanctified. For as the word muſt come before a thing be lawful; ſo praier muſt come before a thing be proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: hence is it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Apoſtle willeth vs to pray continually, and many haue vſed prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue done any thing, that that which they were to doe might bee ſanctified while they were in doing it,<note place="margin">Act. 20.36.38. 1. King. 18.38.</note> &amp; bleſſed when they had done it. As Paul prayed before hee iourney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Eliah prayed before he ſacrificed. Tobias prayed before he bedded, the Iſraelites pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before they bickred, &amp;c: and all to teach vs, that we muſt pray before we iourney, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ſacrifice, before wee bed, before wee fight, before we doe any thing, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods aide and aſſiſtance we can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.5.</note> and therefore not take phiſicke to our good; (though the phiſicke that we take be neuer ſo good.) But to paſſe from this, and to come to the third, which was conſideration, I ſay with that, he that takes phyſicke is to take
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:184271:114"/>
it, becauſe a man muſt reſt no more vpon phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, than he may, nor truſt any more to it than he ought. Phyſicke hath a certaine ende, though mans appetite hath no ende, and that ende muſt he well minde, that minds to take phiſicke as he ought. Further than the ende he muſt not goe, now the right and proper ende of phiſicke is, the continuing and lengthening of life to his naturall period, which is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame point of life, beyond which by no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible meanes it can longer be preſerued, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing been thereby oftimes before helped and continued: for then is nature wholy ſpent. When therefore he takes phiſicke, euen whilſt he is taking of it, he muſt not thinke, that any waies by it he can preuent either olde age or death, for that is impoſſible, and impoſſible cannot be changed by phiſicke. God himſelfe that is incurable hath ſet it downe, that all men muſt once die and bee changed, becauſe all men haue often ſinned. And therefore to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape death by any meanes no man muſt euer either hope or expect.</p>

               <p>You ſay true: and what pleaſed you ſhall not diſpleaſe me: for it aunſwers the courſe before propounded, and hitherto fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. The firſt thing the ſicke man is to doe concerning his neighbour, is to ſeeke recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with him: for if he muſt doe nothing out of charitie, he muſt not die out of charitie: for the greateſt worke that man hath to doe in this world is to die. But the Apoſtle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that nothing muſt be done out of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 16.14</note> for he ſaith. <hi>Let all your things be done in loue:</hi> and therefore die a man muſt not out of charitie. For one of his things it is to die, and as euen now you heard, one of his greateſt. Moreouer, if in the olde teſtament, a man was to doe what I ſay, when he was to offer but a beaſt in ſacrifice vnto God, much more is he to do it at Death, when he is to offer himſelfe, his ſoule and bodie, a ſacrifice of a ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſauour vnto God. For that which was an hinderance to the acceptation of a beaſt to be offred in ſacrifice, will much more be an hindrance to the acceptation of a man to be offered in ſacrifice: for the ſacrifice of a man is greater than the ſacrifice of a beaſt: but then he was to doe it. For then it was ſaid: If thou bring thy gift to the altar,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.23.</note> and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:184271:116"/>
that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leaue there thine offring, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift: for without reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of his ſacrifice, there was no accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>When you ſhall ſtretch out your hands,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 1.15.</note> 
                  <hi>I will hide mine eyes from you, ſaith the Lord, and though yee make many prayers, I will not heare: for your hands are full of blood.</hi> Now therefore alſo he is to doe it; for now it is ſaid: <hi>When ye ſhall ſtand and pray, forgiue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 11.25.</note> 
                  <hi>if yee haue any thing against any man, that your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo which is in heauen may forgiue you your treſpaſſes. For if you will not forgiue, your father which is in heauen, will not pardon you your treſpaſſes.</hi> And no meruaile, for without peace betweene man and man, there is no peace betweene man and God. Without loue all is nothing. Saith Paul: <hi>Though I ſpeake with the tongues of men and Angels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and haue not loue, I am as ſounding braſſe, or a tinkling cymball.

And though I feede the poore with all my goods, and though I giue my bodie that I be burned, and haue not loue, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> And ſaith Iohn. <hi>If any man ſay, I loue God,</hi>

The ſeruant therefore fell downe and beſought him ſaying, maſter appeaſe thine anger toward me, and I will pay thee all. Then that ſeruants maſter had compaſſion, and looſed him, and forgaue him the debt.

Then his fellow fell downe at his feete, and beſought him ſaying, appeaſe thine anger toward me, and I will pay thee all. Yet he would not, but went and caſt him into priſon, till he ſhould pay the debt. And when his other fellowes ſaw what was done, they were very ſorie, and came and declared vnto their maſter, all that was done. Then his maſter cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and ſaid vnto him. O euill ſeruant, I forgaue thee all that debt becauſe thou praiedſt me. Oughteſt not thou alſo to haue had pitie on thy fellow euen as I had pitie on thee? So his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was wroth, and deliuered him to the Iaylers,

If he be eccleſiaſticall, he muſt caſt as much as he can for the continuance of the good eſtate of the Church, ouer which he is placed. It is little for a man to care onely for himſelfe and his owne time, and to regard nothing the time that is to enſue. By the hiſtorie of the Goſpell it is euident, what care the chiefe ſhepheard and Biſhop of our ſoules, had of this matter, for both before his death, and at his death, and after his death he was mindfull and zealous of this buſines, before his death he choſe certaine

to ſucceed him in the miniſtry of the word; at his death as hee commended Iohn to Mary,<note place="margin">Ioh. 19.26.</note> ſo he commended Mary to Iohn, to her hee ſaid, woman behold thy ſonne, to him he ſaid, man,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note> behold thy mother.

In the ſecond Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Peter the Apoſtle, it is eaſie to be ſeene how carefull hee was to perſiſt in his maſters ſteppes, in regarding what hee regarded, for there this was his ſaying:<note place="margin">2.

the due execution of Iuſtice; &amp; to ſeeke by all meanes the outward peace of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and common wealth, this if he doth, there is no doubt, but he ſhall prouide peace for his people for ſometime after his death. Some I am ſure there are mentioned in ſcripture, who by taking this courſe while they liued, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red peace to their people, when they were dead. When Moſes was an hundreth &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeres olde, and was no more able to goe in and out before the people of Iſrael, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them before him, and ſignified that the time of his departure was at hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tooke order for their welfare after his death. Firſt of all hee placed Iehoſhua ouer them in his ſteed to be their guide to the land of promiſe. Secondly he gaue ſpeciall charge to all his people, to be valiant and couragious againſt their enemies, and to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, how they ſpeed heere through the book of Ioſhua better manifeſts then I can mention. Yet in a generalitie thus much can I ſay, that here through they ſped wonderous well, their enemies they vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, the land of promiſe they obtained, and much peace and plenty they therein enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 23.</note> the like courſe to Moſes tooke Ioſhua when he was a dying; &amp; the like effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that like taken courſe tooke among the people, for in the book of Ioſhua it is ſaid, <hi>that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:184271:125"/>
all Iſrael ſerued the Lord all the daies of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua and all the daies of the Elders that ouer-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Ioſhua,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.

To come to the miniſter now: if hee will haue the word to ſound in his Church no leſſe after his death then it did in his life, in his life he is diligently to preach it to his people, and chriſtianly to walke according to the ſame, and at his death he is to propound to his and his Churches pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, a man for gifts ſufficiently qualified, &amp; for manners of many well commended, and of his people much eſteemed, this if he doth, there is little doubt, but that, that after his death will bee obtained, which at his dying was greatly wiſhed for, he and his people ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning togither, they ſhall either in deede with this patron preuaile, or verie hardly miſſe; and if it happen that both miſſe what they would, they may there-through notwithſtanding ſpeed better then otherwiſe they ſpeed, for he is extremely ſtiffe that will not bow at the ardent requeſts of many, when that which is requeſted, tendes ſpecially to the good and

comfort of many. But to paſſe ouer this, and poſt to the next. If the houſeholder will haue loue to holde, and quiet to continue amongſt his heires after he is dead; whilſt he liues, and before he dies, he is to diſpoſe of the goods, be they many or few which God of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hath heere vouchſafed him. This if he doth, it is not to bee feared, but that will fall out which I haue ſaid: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery one knowes his part and portion, how ſhal they not accord and agree? the ignorance of his portion cauſeth each man to ſtriue for a portion, that thinks he hath right to a portion.

               <p>I doe ſo; and in ſo doing, I hope I doe no more than I may doe, neither yet any thing leſſe than that which euery man ought to doe, for that which God by Iſaiah the prophet ſpake vnto Hezekiah the king being ſicke, I take as ſpoken to euery man being ſicke aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well well as to Hezekiah. For what is ſpoken in the ſcripture to one man, is ſpoken for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of another man. And that I may the more boldly thinke it to be ſo taken, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the wiſe man to his ſonne in the booke of Ieſus the ſonne of Syrach doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade mee. For thus there and by him it is ſaid:<note place="margin">Syr. 33. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>At the time when thou ſhalt ende thy dayes, and finiſh thy life, diſtribute thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> But whether it be or no, the matter is not much. For I haue at hand the practiſe of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:184271:126"/>
many auncient and worthie men, which doe prooue that it ought to be ſuch. Gen. 25. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham before his death makes his will and giues legacies.<note place="margin">Gen. 25.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham gaue all his goods to Izaak, but vnto the ſonnes of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gaue gifts.

So doth Iacob.<note place="margin">Gen. 49.3.</note> And ſo doth Chriſt our Sauiour vpon the croſſe, to his father hee giues his ſoule,<note place="margin">Luk. 23.46.52.</note> (father into thine hands I commend my ſpirit) to Ioſeph of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea, he giues his bodie;<note place="margin">Iohn 19.27.21.15. Luk. 23.43.34.</note> to Iohn he giues his mother, to Peter he giues his church, to the repentant theefe he giues paradiſe; to the ſouldiers he giues his garments. And of theſe I gather what I haue ſaid, and in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nothing amiſſe, both becauſe their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to vs good inſtructions, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the action it ſelfe is aunſwerable to Chriſtian conuerſation. For firſt, by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, a man is in his life ſo to diſpoſe of thoſe goods which God hath lent him, as that his diſpoſition of them may make much to the glory of God after his death. Secondly, a man is ſo to diſpoſe of his goods in his life time, as there may be none occaſion of ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention betweene any of thoſe he leaues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him after his death. Thirdly, a man in ſickenes is ſo to diſpoſe of his goods, as his goods may nothing diſquiet him in his ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:184271:127"/>
nor any thing diſtract him from proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for his latter ende. Now by making of a will in ſickenes (if then it be vmade) a man may ſo diſpoſe of his goods, as thereby he may geatly glorifie the name of God, which gaue them; throughly breake off ſtrife and diſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene them, which ſhall haue them, and ſingularly quiet himſelfe that is to depart from them. And therefore I iudge it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for a man to make a will; and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to make or not to make. For firſt in all things a man muſt ſeeke the glorie of God. For the Apoſtle ſaith;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10 32</note> 
                  <hi>Whether yee eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer ye doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi> Secondly, aboue all things a man muſt put on loue,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.8. 1. Cor. 1.3.6</note> for as Peter ſaith, <hi>Loue couereth a multitude of ſinnes.</hi> And ſaith Paul, <hi>Loue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth not in iniquitie.</hi> And our Sauior him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Wee be to the man by whome the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence commeth. It were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his necke, and that he were drowned in the depth of the ſea.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 16.18</note> 
                  <hi>They which cauſe diuiſion and offences, are ſuch as ſerue not the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, but their owne bellies,</hi> ſaith Paul. And therefore againe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.32</note> 
                  <hi>Giue none offence, neither to the Iewes, nor to the Grecians, nor to the Church of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.4.</note> Thirdly, <hi>A meeke and quiet ſpirit before God is a thing much ſet by.</hi> As Peter the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the firſt of his Epiſtles anoucheth. But
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:184271:127"/>
to draw home and driue to a point, the one and the other, and euery of theſe are this way gotten. For a man making his will well and wiſely, doth thereby prouoke others to glorifie God for giuing him will and wiſedome ſo to diſpoſe of the things of this life, and to imitate him in the like. Alſo he doth thereby cut off much hatred and contention, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might or would ariſe. For the making of a will is the ſtaying of many ſuits in lawes. By it many a queſtion is decided, ſome doubts are reſolued, all hatred is preuented (except more fault be in thoſe that remaine aliue, than in him that is departed and gone.) Moreouer he doth thereby procure himſelfe the more quiet in minde, the greater libertie to attend vpon God and his pleaſure; the beſt oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie that may be to frame himſelfe to another world. Still and ſtill therefore I commend the making of will before a man dies; but euer and euer I condemne the leauing of all at ſixe and ſeauen, when hee dies.

Oftimes alſo all theſe proue ſo extreme, as euery man beſides that hath any ſparke of wit, or loue to peace, ſaith: It is great pitie, that ſuch a man died without a will; that the leaſt

bleſſings. For what ſhould a man be aſhamed of the good gifts of God giuen vnto him? It is his part rather to manifeſt them, that ſo God may be the more glorified for giuing them, than to conceale them.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.7.</note> 
                  <hi>For what hath he which hee hath not receiued? and if hee hath not what hee receiued not, why doth hee conceale them, as if hee receiued them not?</hi> It is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers duty, to acknowledge the giuers bountie. No more is the ſecond, becauſe it argues too much pride. And what ſhould duſt and aſhes be then proud, when he is to returne to duſt and aſhes. It is his duty rather to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the dealing of the Lord with him, that others may take heed by him, how they abuſe the good gifts of GOD beſtowed on them, than to conceale it. As it is God that maketh rich, ſo it is God that maketh poore (for he ſetteth vp one, and pulleth downe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:) and what ſhould vaine man deſire to appeare better than God himſelfe will haue him to be? he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will obtayne mercy muſt not conceale his owne miſerie. Neither yet is the third, becauſe it argues too great loue of life, &amp; too much feare of death. And what ſhuld a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too much loue that which once hee muſt lay down, or too greatly feare that which one day he muſt vndergo? It is his duty rather to ſubmit himſelfe vnder the mighty hand a God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his prayer, thy kingdome come, thy wil
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:184271:129"/>
be done, &amp;c, than otherwiſe. The dayes of man are numbred: his time appointed which he cannot ouer-paſſe: though therefore he makes a thouſand willes (if it were poſſible for one man to make ſo many) yet ſhall he die neuer the ſooner: God prolongs not the dayes of a man for the want of a will. For they die aſwel, which neuer makes any, as they which make many: neither doth he ſhorten them becauſe he hath made any: for ſome haue made many, and yet liue at this d y. But to let this paſſe: of as little force is the fourth as the firſt, or as any that yet haue followed. And the reaſon is, becauſe it argues too fond a liking of kinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes, aboue the duty that is owing vnto God. And what ſhould a man ſo fooliſhly loue his kinred, as for loue of them hee will omit the performance of the dutie, which hee ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto God? It is his part rather to doe that which may pleaſe God, than that which may pleaſe his friends.<note place="margin">Gal. 1.10.</note> Saith Paul, <hi>If I ſhould yet pleaſe men, I were not the ſeruant of Chriſt.</hi> And ſaith Chriſt himſelfe;<note place="margin">Mar. 10.37.</note>

neglect thereof they in the end ſpeed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than they will like. While they are a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to that, I will looke to that they ſay. And me thinke without further looking I may well ſay, that their pretence of not making a will is meerely falſe. For the making of a will is the quieting of their kinſfolkes mindes, for when their kinſfolkes ſee and know that there is a will made, their mindes are quieted, and all ſtrife, that might for want thereof after riſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, is wholy ſtaid and precided. So that ſtill it is good for the ſicke; for the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of order in his houſe after his death, to take care for the making of a will in his life, and not to ſtay himſelfe therefro for any of theſe vaine pretences named, they all being alreadie ſufficiently proued inſufficient.</p>

               <p>I ſay not but ſuch they may be, but ſure I am, that ſuch they are not. For they which are rightly liberall, are liberall of their owne. But theſe, if they be any waies liberall, they are liberall of other mens. That which is vniuſtly gotten, is theirs from whom it is gotten, and not theirs by whome it is gotten. So that they giuing of that which is vniuſtly gotten from other men, cannot be counted liberall for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to whom they would giue.</p>

               <p>You may aſwell doubt of the ſunnes being in heauen or your owne liuing on earth. What reaſon is there, that God ſhould not accept aſwell of him that would reſtore and cannot, becauſe he is not able, as of him that could and did not though he were able (for ought we reade?) if a good will thereto was good in him that was rich and able to haue reſtored, though he did not; it cannot but be alſo good in him that is poore and vnable to reſtore, no doubt but he that came to ſaue the poore aſwell as the rich, will accept of a good will in the poore aſwell as in the rich. In his life time he made ſo great reckoning of the poore, as he not onely came of the poore, but alſo conuerſed with the poore, preached to the poore, made choyce of the poore, ſpake much in the behalfe of the poore, gaue gifts to the poore, yea and did many things for the poore. And now being dead, riſen againe, and aſcended into heauen, ſhall wee thinke him leſſe mindfull of the poore, or leſſe mercifull to the poore? no, no. As his power is thereby increaſed, ſo his mercie is therefore nothing abated. Now his eies are vpon the poore, his eares are open to the cry of the poore, his heart conſidereth the deepe ſighing of the poore: much he regardeth the companie of the poore, and well be prouideth for the congregation of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:184271:143"/>

                  <hi>God hath choſen the poore of this world, that they ſhould be rich in faith, and heires of the kingdome, which he promiſed to them that loue him.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing choſen them, may we thinke, he will not accept a good will in them, they wanting power to worke what they will? ſurely no.

                  <hi>God hath not caſt away his people which he knew before.</hi> Secondly, againe the ſame Paul ſaith. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen?</hi> Thirdly, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith, <hi>They ſhall neuer periſh, neither ſhall any plucke them out of my hand.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 10.28.</note> No doubt then, but if they will well, where they can worke but little, God will accept of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their will.

               <p>Yes debtes, aſwell as giftes. For giftes, if you looke well about you, are none other but debts. Firſt, God commaundes the giuing of

gifts aſwell as the paying of debts. And as I take it, it is a debt to obey the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: in reſpect therefore of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, the giuing of gifts, is a debte aſwell as the paying of debts. Secondly, the cauſe of gifts is none other than a debt: and as I gueſſe, the effect is not vnlike the cauſe in reſpect of the cauſe of gifts, gifts are debts: For loue is the cauſe of gifts.

                  <hi>Well then to ſhut vp this point, becauſe I both ſee, that this which you ſay is very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to a number of diſtreſſed ſoules, that haue a minde to reſtore what in times paſt they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly gat, though they want might, where with to accompliſhe it; and alſo becauſe I know not what may betide my ſelfe, being but a frayle man if God leaue me to my ſelfe, I acknowledge what you haue ſaid, to be as you haue ſaid.

                  <hi>Firſt, If a man be able to reſtore, what order you would wiſh him to obſerue in reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? Secondly, If he be vnable to reſtore all, and they vnable to forbeare the want of that which he hath vniuſtly gotten, what courſe,</hi> He that would reſtore all and cannot, <hi>You would wiſh him to take, that would reſtore all and cannot?</hi>

               <p>Touching theſe two points, what I my ſelfe thinke without preiudice to any other, you ſhall ſoone and ſhortly heare. And firſt concerning the firſt I ſay, if he be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore and willing with his abilitie to doe it, he needes not obſerue any order in his reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. He may beginne where he will, and ende with whom he liſt. Yet this much he euer beare in minde, that therein he makes as much haſt as he can, leaſt that delaying too long, he be driuen not onely to reſtore the things taken, but alſo to recompence for the damage by the taking, and the detriment through this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning, and that according to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the things and their damages. If they be certaine, then according to their certaintie muſt he reſtore. If they bee vncertaine as in iniuries oft it falleth out, then according to the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:184271:146"/>
iudgement of ſome honeſt, wiſe and diſcret man he muſt reſtore, hauing alwaies an eye to the ſeuerall circumſtances of the thing; the time; the place and the perſon. Now concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſecond I ſay. Firſt, he muſt conſider the things which he hath taken, and ſhould reſtore, whether they be certaine or vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine? the perſons from whom he hath taken, whether they be in better caſe than himſelfe, or as meane, and worſe. If the things he hath taken, be ſome certaine, and ſome vncertaine, he muſt reſtore the certaine before the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; (except the vncerteine be ſuch as it is certaine they were neuer any mans certaine: for ſuch may well be giuen to the poore) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the things which are certaine, thoſe things which do yet remaine in their kinde, are firſt to be reſtored, after they are reſtored re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, is to be made for them which are periſhed. For the things which are vncertaine, whether they were any mans certainely, yea or no, they may be reſtored according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and counſaile of ſome honeſt and diſcret man, or elſe for his owne benefit, as one of Chriſts little ones reſerued, ſo there were no daunger of further theft afterward to enſue feared dreaded or ſuſpected. If the perſons whom he hath taken vniuſtly and wrongfully be in farre better caſe than himſelf he himſelfe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being in great neceſſitie; it is ſufficient that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:184271:147"/>
he hath a good will to reſtore, though actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he doth not then reſtore: but if the perſons from whom he hath vniuſtly gotten, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully kept, be in as meane caſe as himſelfe, and worſe to, then ought he to reſtore what he hath to reſtore, or elſe to recompence as farre forth as he may.<note place="margin">Pro. 28.3.</note> For as Salomon ſaith: <hi>A poore man if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.</hi> And thus now you haue heard what you were deſirous to heare.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt you ſay, if the perſon from whome he hath vnlawfully taken and vniuſtly gotten, be in farre better caſe than himſelfe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, you ſay, if the perſon from whome he hath vniuſtly either taken or gotten, bee in as meane an estate as himſelfe, or worſe, he then being in no great good caſe, it is his part and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:184271:147"/>
dutie either to reſtore the thing it ſelfe if it be, or to recompence for it, if it bee not. And heere I demaunde, whether a man ought not more to loue his owne life than his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours?</hi>

               <p>To the firſt of theſe demaunds, I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that if he recouers his health, and after comes to greater wealth hee is to reſtore, if not the thing hee had vniuſtly gotte, yet the equiualent to the thing, if ſo bee that any time hee had occupied the thing ere euer hee came to neceſſitie. And my reaſon heereof is, becauſe ſuch occupying of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans goods was vnlawfull. But if hee neuer occupied it before hee came to that his extreeme neceſſitie, I ſaid ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for before. To the ſecond I aunſwere yes, ſo hee ſeekes not vniuſtly to mainteyne it. But the mainteyning of his life by taking from another poorer than himſelfe is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe ſo hee killes another to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne himſelfe. He killes another by ſubtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him, what is neceſſarie for him. For as Syrach ſaith: <hi>The bread of the neeedefull is the life of the poore:</hi>

but to the matter againe controuerted.

The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould rather remember the loue hee beares to his ſonne, and the obedience hee owes to his God, than thus ſeeke to reuenge the miſdemeanour of his ſonne againſt him, the fault that is in his ſonne, at that time hee ſhould forgiue and forget. The time of death is no time for reuenge: as he would then be forgiuen, ſo ſhould he willingly forgiue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his owne treſpaſſe againſt his father, God almightie, he would be loath to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited of his kingdome; ſo becauſe of his ſonnes treſpaſſe againſt him, he ſhould be vnwilling to diſpoſſes him of that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe (if his treſpaſſe had beene away) ſhould haue deſcended vnto him. What though the ſonne forgets he is a ſonne, yet muſt not therefore the father forget that he is a father. The hiſtorie of Dauid and Abſolom teaches no ſuch matter. For though Abſolom was as vngratious a ſonne to Dauid, as a ſonne almoſt might be, yet was not therefore Dauid as vnkinde a father, as a father could be. When Abſolom followed him ouer Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane,

with a purpoſe to diſpoſſes him of his kingdome.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 18.5</note>

To which when Cuſhi anſwered, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of my Lord the king, and all that riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee to doe thee hurt, be as that young man is: Dauid the king was moued, and went vp to the chamber ouer the gate and wept, and as he went, he thus ſaid: O my ſonne Abſalom, my ſonne, my ſonne Abſolom: would God I had dyed for thee ô Abſalom, my ſonne, my ſonne.</hi> By this hiſtory Parents may learne, not to be too vnkinde to their children, how euer their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be vnkinde to them, eſpecially at their farewell to them and to the world: for alas, what pleaſure may it doe them when they are gone; ſo to haue dealt with them ere they did goe? What a perpetuall blot to their names in ſo doing, ſhall they leaue behinde them? What an euill example ſhall they giue to other? What a torment ſhall they fixe in the heart and conſcience of their diſtreſſed children? For theſe and other conſiderations, I could wiſh that Parents would not be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles to their children when they come to dye, how euer they ſeemed mindles of them while they did liue. It is hard to dye with an

hard minde toward them. A father pittieth his childe; a father prouideth for his childe. What fathers are they that neither pitie them hauing done amiſſe, nor prouide for them being in diſtreſſe? If at no other time they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe either, yet at their dying time they ſhould vſe both pitie, that they may be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled together; prouiſion, that their ofſpring may flouriſh when they are gone both, that many may thence take inſtruction, and ſome thereby reape conſolation: though their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were graceles while they themſelues li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with them, yet this heaping of coales vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads, may make them gracious when they are gone from them. It may kindle a fire of grace in their hearts. And after they may ſeriouſly repent, what fooliſhlie in times paſt they did commit.

               <p>Though hee bee, yet muſt hee not be thought ſo, becauſe God himſelfe hath not thought him ſo. And the reaſon of his not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo, no man muſt aske. His will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination is reaſon enough for his action or conſtitution. It is ſufficient for vs to know that he will haue it ſo, though we neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire why he will haue it ſo. Yet if any be ſo ſcrupulous, or ſo curious, as hee likes not of Gods conſtitution without a reaſon, reaſon is ſoone at hand to be found. For God the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of reaſon doth nothing without reaſon. Now there may be three reaſons giuen of the Lords appointing the eldeſt to haue moſt of all, and more than any, the firſt is his elderſhip, which God himſelfe hath ratified as a reaſon why he ſhould haue more than all or any of the reſt. For thus ſaith the Lord in Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: <hi>If a man haue two wiues, one loued and another hated,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deu. 21.15, 16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and they haue borne him chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, both the loued and alſo the hated, if the firſt borne be the ſonne of the hated, then when the time commeth that he appointeth his ſonnes to be heires of that which he hath he may not make the ſonne of the beloued firſt borne, before the ſonne of the hated which is the firſt borne. But he ſhall acknowledge the ſonne of the hated for the firſt borne, and giue him double portion of that he hath. For he is the firſt of his ſtrength,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:184271:155"/>
and to him belongeth the right of the firſt borne.</hi> The ſecond is the preſeruation of the ſtocke, which in his perſon is to be mainteyned. For in the elder brother from the father to the ſonne the ſtocke is alwaies continued. Among the Iewes the father being dead, the eldeſt ſonne was to all the reſt as father, and therefore hee was honoured of all the reſt as father. In Noahs houſe Sem was the eldeſt, and more is ſaid of him being eldeſt than of the reſt. Bleſſed bee the Lord God of Sem, and let Canaan bee his ſeruant.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.26.27.</note> God perſwade Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that he may dwell in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his ſeruant in Iacobs houſe Reuben was the eldeſt,<note place="margin">Gen. 37.22.</note> and more was his counſell regarded being eldeſt than others. When all the reſidue of the brethren were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed againſt Ioſeph that he ſhould be ſlaine, his only diſagreeing was cauſe ſufficient why Ioſeph was not ſlaine. Amongſt our ſelues, the prerogatiues of the eldeſt are more and greater than any of all the reſt. I neede not to ſpeake of them, he that is any thing acquainted with the lawes of this land, is not ignorant of them. He that is the eldeſt in any family, will ſoone labour to know them. I will proceede: the third reaſon is the hauing of ſome alwaies in readines to doe ſeruice for the common wealth. In the time of peace to helpe to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne it; in the time of warre, to helpe to defend
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:184271:155"/>
it. For of all the brethren if he were vnfit, who ſhould be more fit? for yeares it is ſure he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes them all, for experience it is thought, he excelles them all: as he hath moſt yeares, ſo he ſhould haue moſt experience. For by moſt yeares comes moſt experience. For theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the eldeſt ſhould haue portions of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers goods and landes, both bigger for quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, and better for qualitie, than any of all his other brethren.</p>

                  <hi>Some times I deny not what you ſay. But that alwaies it ſhould be ſo, I doe not greatly well like of: for at the time of the fathers death the eldeſt may be able to ſhift for himſelfe, as well as ſome of the reſt, but the youngeſt may bee very vnable. And therefore I would thinke greater care ſhould bee had of them, than of others. Beſides that, it may bee the youngeſt ſhall bee brought vp to ſome chargeable kinde of life, as a ſchollers life, a courtiers life, a merchants life &amp;c. and therefore ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as great care ſhould be had of them as of ſome others.</hi>

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:184271:156"/>
now doe I ſtand againſt the well prouiding for of the youngeſt. If the eldeſt be once regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as he ought, let the others after him be conſidered, as they may. Yet for that point thus much I ſay, whatſoeuer is done, let it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be done vpon reaſon than affection. Many I know are fooliſhly affected: and therefore ſome of their children are careleſly regarded: ſome haue a great deale giuen them, and ſome againe haue neuer a whit.

               <p>I gather it three waies: firſt, by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall commaundement of God: ſecondly, by the practiſe of diuerſe godly men mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſcripture: thirdly, by the ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, God himſelfe giues to one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aboue the reſt. For firſt, God giues this generall precept,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.13.</note> Heb. 3.13. <hi>Exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dailie, while it is called to day, leaſt any of you bee hardened through the deceitfulnes of ſinne.</hi> And I know little difference betweene exhortation and admonition, vnles you ſay, admonition goeth before exhortation, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation followes after admonition. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I finde many good men in the booke of God to haue done thus. In the booke of Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomie,<note place="margin">Deu. 31.32.33.</note> I finde Moſes to haue admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all Iſraell, Ioſhua their captaine, Leui their Prieſt, and the audience of all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to cleaue vnto the Lord their God,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:184271:157"/>
and to ſerue him after his death. It is ſo much to repeate ſome, as I refer you thither to reade all. The reading of all there, is better by much than the repeating of ſome here. In the booke of Iehoſhua, I finde Iehoſhuah to haue done the like: <hi>For to all Iſrael, their Elders,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iehoſh. 23.1, 2, 3. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>their heads and their Iudges, and their officers, he ſaid, I am olde and ſtricken in age: alſo, ye haue ſeene all that the Lord your God hath done vnto all theſe nations before you, how the Lord your God himſelfe hath fought for you. And the Lord your God ſhall expell them, and cast them out of your ſight, and ye ſhall poſſes their land, as the Lord your God hath ſayd vnto you: be therefore of a valiant courage, to obſerue and doe all that is written in the booke of the lawe of Moſes, that ye turne not there from to the right hand, nor to the left; neither companie with thoſe nations: that is, with them that are left with you, neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cauſe to ſweare by them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerue them, nor bowe vnto them, but ſticke fast vnto the Lord your God, as ye haue done vnto this day, &amp;c.</hi> Ioſh. 23. and 24. by the whole. In the firſt booke of Kings I finde,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 2.1.2</note> 
                  <hi>Dauid to haue charged his ſonne Salomon to the like effect, ſaying: I goe the way of all earth, be ſtrong therefore and ſhew thy ſelfe a man, and take heede to the charge of the Lord thy God, to walke in his waies, to keepe his ſtatutes
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:184271:158"/>
and his commaundements, and his iudgements, and his testimonies, as it is written in the lawe of Moſes, that thou maiest prosper in all that thou doest, and in euery thing whereto thou turnest thee, that the Lord may confirme his word which he ſpake vnto me, ſaying: If thy ſonnes take heede to their way, that they walke before me in trueth, with all their hearts, and with all their ſoules, thou ſhalt not (ſayd he) want one of thy posteritie vpon the throne of Iſrael.</hi> In the booke of Tobit alſo I finde, <hi>That olde Tobit no ſooner remembred that hee had wiſhed for death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tobit. 4.2.</note> 
                  <hi>but hee ſaid; wherefore doe I not call for my ſonne Tobias, that I may admoniſh him before I dye:</hi> (as though when a man were a dying, it were his duetie to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh his ſonnes, and thoſe of his familie to doe thoſe things which are pleaſing vnto him, which gaue them life, and may at his pleaſure take it againe from them:) <hi>And therefore when he had called him he ſayd: My ſonne, after that I am dead, burie me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not thy mother, but honour her all the dayes of thy life, and doe that which ſhall pleaſe her, and anger her not. Remember my ſonne, how many dangers ſhe ſusteyned when thou waſt in her wombe, and when ſhe dyeth, burie her by me in the ſame graue. My ſonne, ſet our Lord God alwaies before thine eyes, and let not thy will be ſet to ſinne, or to tranſgreſſe the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:184271:158"/>
of God. Doe vprightlie all thy life long, and follow not the waies of vnrighteouſnes: for if thou deale truely, thy doings ſhall prosperouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſucceed to thee, and to all them that liue iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and ſo forth as followeth in that place. Now by all this which I haue found, this is the concluſion which I make, to wit, that what good thing ſoeuer men know, touching God and godlines, they are not to keepe it to themſelues, but to teach it their children and families, not onely in their life time, but alſo at their death, that ſo God may be glorified of them, both while they liue, and alſo when they dye. And the third thing that induces me thereto, ouer and aboue the precept of God, and the practiſe of good men, (of which I haue now ſpoken) is the ſpeciall commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion God himſelfe giues to Abraham, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull, for the doing of the ſame: for when he was to diſcouer vnto him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Sodome and Gomorhe, he made this the reaſon of his ſo doing.<note place="margin">Gen. 18.19,</note> 
                  <hi>I know Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham that he will commaund his ſonnes and his houſeholde after him, that they keepe the way of the Lorde, to doe righteouſnes and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And what a ſingular commendation this is, hee that hath but halfe an eye may ſee? It is a very good thing to be well ſpoken of by men.<note place="margin">Senec. de Reme. fort.</note>

                  <hi>and aboue golde. A good name is better than a good oyntment.</hi> But it is a better thing to bee well ſpoken of by God himſelfe: as hee better knoweth what is in man, ſo hee better iudgeth what is done by man: as he alſo is greater than man, ſo is his commendation better than mans. Mans is hardly got, and eaſilie loſt, Gods once got, is euer hardly loſt: as hee knowes what hee ſpeakes, ere he ſpeakes; ſo he ſpeakes ſurely when he ſpeakes. As Balaam ſaid to Balak. <hi>God is not as man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 22.19</note>

               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what is the reaſon that he that is ſicke, ſhould in his ſickenes be carefull of that you ſpeake of? It may be in his health he hath often before done it?</hi>

            </sp>

               <speaker>R.</speaker>
               <p>That hinders not, but that then alſo he muſt doe it. It is a duetie that lyes vpon a man, not onely in the time of health, but in the time of ſickenes alſo: though therefore in his health he hath neuer ſo often admoniſht all thoſe of his familie to feare God and keepe his commaundements, yet then in his ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he is not to ceaſe to admoniſh them ſtill: ofte had Moſes and Ioſhua admoniſht the Iſraelites to ſerue the Lord, and walke in his waies, ere euer the time of their departure drew nigh, yet did they not therefore ceaſe to doe it, euen then, when the time came that they were to depart. No more ſhould he that is ſicke, and at the poynt to dye: you aske here what is the reaſon he ſhould then doe it, but you might better aske what are the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thereof: for they are many, more than one. One is, becauſe it is the laſt and beſt worke he can then doe and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Deſire you the beſt gifts:</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.3. Gal. 6.9. 2. Theſ. 3.13</note> 
                  <hi>Bee not wearie of, and in well doing: for in due ſeaſon ye ſhall reape, if yee faint not.</hi> Another is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:184271:160"/>
it is euery mans part to ſeeke the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Gods glorie, as well when he is dying, as while he is liuing. For therefore the Lord created him. Eſa. 43.7. <hi>I created him for my glorie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 41.7.</note> And againe, verſe 21. <hi>This people haue I formed for my ſelfe, they ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.8.</note> The Apoſtle alſo ſaith, <hi>Whether we liue or dye, wee are the Lordes:</hi> and therefore while we liue, we ſhould liue vnto the Lord, and when we dye, we ſhould dye vnto the Lord. And becauſe liuing we ſhould liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and dying dye to the Lord, both liuing and dying, we ſhould admoniſh others to liue and dye vnto the Lord. Liuing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle one where ſaith, <hi>Exhorte one another, and edifie one another, euen as yee doe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.11 14.</note> and verſe there the 14. <hi>Admoniſh them that are vnrulie dying;</hi> becauſe the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle other where ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.31</note> 
                  <hi>Whether yee eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer you doe, doe all to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God,</hi> and therefore this: for this makes much to the glorie of God. Steuens vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exhortation to the Iewes before his death, made ſome turne vnto God after his death. Saith Auguſtine in one of his bookes <hi>de ciuitate Dei.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auguſtinus de ciuitate Dri.</note> 
                  <hi>If Steuen had not prayed, the Church had not had Paul the Doctor of the Gentiles.</hi> Through the many good wordes which Chriſt vſed, as he went to be crucified, ſome were either conuerted or confirmed:
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:184271:160"/>
the theefe was conuerted, the Centurion was confirmed, by both, God was glorified: the theefe ſaid,<note place="margin">Luk. 23.42.43. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Lorde remember mee when thou commeſt into thy kingdome,</hi> and he receiued this anſwer. <hi>To day ſhalt thou bee with mee in Paradiſe. The Centurion when hee ſaw what was done, he glorified God, ſaying: Of a ſuretie this man was iuſt. And all the people that came together to that ſight, beholding the things which were done, ſmote their breaſts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</hi> But I will returne to that, from which I was not yet turned. And a third reaſon thereof is, becauſe then a man ſpeakes with the beſt affection. Seldome when a man is well affected, if in his mortall ſickenes he be ill affected: for as Salomon ſaith,<note place="margin">Pro. 29.15.</note> 
                  <hi>The rod and correction giue wiſedome.</hi> And therefore Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid ſayd: <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.67</note> 
                  <hi>but now (that I am afflicted, I keepe thy worde.</hi> By the good admonitions which Moſes, and Ioſhua, and Dauid, and Tobit, and others, of whom I haue ſpoken) gaue vnto their ſonnes ſubiects and ſeruants, a little before their deaths, the trueth of this I ſay, doth very eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appeare: and by other things which ſhall hereafter bee ſaid, the ſame may further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. If either of theſe be not enough, there may be ſome further thought had of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches dying, the Prophets dying: Chriſt himſelfe dying, the chiefe crucified with dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:184271:161"/>
Steuen the Martyr dying, for there will be ſeene the ardent affection they ſpake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, when they were dying, and ſo that explay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned which I was explayning. But a fourth reaſon is at hand, and therefore I muſt from this. And that fourth for which a man dying, ſhould admoniſh thoſe of his familie to cleaue vnto the Lord, is becauſe the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is then deliuered, is euer beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. How ſoone ſoeuer other in other time paſt giuen, is gone and forgotten, that in that time giuen, is ſeldome when wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. No words are euer ſo well thought of, as a mans laſt words: with them, he which will not be moued, with any will hardly be moued. A tree neuer giues ſo big a ſtroke, as when it falls: and a man neuer ſpeakes with ſuch efficacie, as when hee dyes: as then the Swan ſings moſt ſweetely, ſo as then a man ſpeakes moſt pathetically. All parts are then in great force, becauſe they haue but a while to bee in force. And thus your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde is anſwered, though your minde be not ſatiſfied.</p>

And this viſitation of God, is vnto me welcome, and I thanke the Lord with all my heart for it. I doubt not but when I am once gone hence, I ſhall be in a far better caſe than euer I was: therefore I pray thee good wife be not heauie, neither take thought for me, but rather pray that the will of God may be done in me: and be as well contented, that I
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:184271:162"/>
ſhould at the calling of God goe from thee, as euer thou waſt that at his appoyntment I ſhould come to thee. I haue run my race; I haue paſſed thoſe yeares which the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted that I ſhould liue in this world. And now is the time of my departure come. And I giue ouer this my life willingly, and with a free heart, therefore take no thought for me: and doubt thou not ſweete wiſe, but if thou goeſt forth, to liue in the feare of God, and to pleaſe him, God in the time of thy widow-hoode will be an husband vnto thee, he will be thy patrone and defender, hee will be thy mightie ſhield and ſtrong buckler, hee will prouide for thee, and foreſee, that thou and thine ſhall want nothing that is good.

Chuſe thee therefore ſuch an husband as will loue thee, and not thy goods onely, as is equall to thee in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſtate, and age: as alſo will tender thy children, and ſee them brought vp in the feare of God: that this may be, pray alwaies vnto God, that he wil bleſſe thee, and proſper thee in all things. Moreouer (oh my ſweete and louing wife) looke well to the bringing vp of thine and my children: bring them vp in inſtruction and information of the Lorde; weed out of their mindes all kindes of vice and wickednes, that their bodies may bee made the temples of the holy Ghoſt: haue an eye vnto thy ſeruants, giue them their coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and ſuffer them not to be idle.

(Oh my ſweete daughters) I pray God bleſſe you, and make you ioyfull mothers of many children. Serue God, obey your mother, be diligent to pleaſe her. Giue care to her wholeſome admonitions and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them. Doe nothing without her counſell
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:184271:168"/>
and aduiſe. When your age ſhall require you to marrie, follow the counſell of your mother, and other of your faithfull friends, which wiſh you to doe well in chuſing of your husbands. Take heede ye be not corrupted with the gifts of naughtie packes, nor deceiued with the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring tongues of wicked and vnthriftie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For many in theſe dayes ſeeke not the woman, but the womans ſubſtance. Couple your ſelues with ſuch as feare God, loue his word, and be of honeſt reporte. And when ye be once maried, reuerence your husbands, know them to be your heads and gouernours appointed of God, obey them, and ſubmit your ſelues vnto them. Suffer not your loue to depart from your husbands, neither know any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beſides them, but keepe the bed vndefiled, that your mariage may be honourable in the ſight of God, and of his holy congregation. And if GOD doth bleſſe you with children, looke that you bring them vp to the glory of God in his feare and doctrine. Engraffe in their young breaſts, euen from their tender age vertue, godlineſſe and good manners. Looke well vnto your houſehold, and be examples to your maides of godlineſſe and honeſtie. Be no gadders abroade, nor haunters of tauernes, but keepe your houſes continually, except ſome earneſt and lawful buſines prouoke you to goe forth. Be no bablers, nor vaine talkers,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:184271:168"/>
but for the moſt part vſe ſilence. For ſilence in a woman is an ornament vnto her. <hi>Apparell your ſelues in comely aray, with ſhamefaſtnes and diſcreet behauiour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.4.</note>

Theſe few leſſons if you obſerue, doubt you not my (deare daughters) but God will well proſper you, and giue you a ioyfull and quiet life vpon earth. In ſteede of me he will be your father, and will defend you better than euer I could or ſhould, pray to him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for his bleſſing, and vexe not your ſelues much for my departure. I am to goe before you, and you are to follow after me. God ſend vs all a good going. And thus Gods bleſſing be with you my daughters.

               <p>This or the like: ſyrs (you my ſeruants) ye ſee in me what ſhall be the ende of you and all fleſh elſe; euen a departure from this vile and tranſitorie world. For we are but ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and pilgrimes on the earth, as all our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were. We haue heere no continuing ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but we ſeeke one to come. The ordinance of God is, that all men ſhall once dye. There liueth no man that ſhall not die. A man in his time is but graſſe, and flouriſheth as as flower of the field. Our life is euen as a vapour that appeareth for a little time, &amp; then vaniſheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. On this condition came wee into the world, that we ſhould againe goe out. We haue been ſure of death euer ſince we had life. Theſe things doe ye now ſee practiſed in me. The time of my departure out of this world is at hand. I thought it good therefore to ſend alſo for you, and to take my leaue of you, till
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:184271:169"/>
we meete againe in the kingdome of God. I thanke you for the good ſeruice that ye haue done me; I haue not forgotten your ſeruicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearts and good will towards me, but I haue giuen to euery one of you ſuch a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of money, as ſhall declare ſome part of my thankefull and wel willing heart toward you. Now this remaineth to bee craued at your hands, that as ye haue hitherto faithfully, true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and honeſtly ſerued me in my life time, euen ſo after my departure (ſo long as ye tary heere) ye will ſhew the like faithfulnes, truth and honeſtie toward your miſtreſſe. Conſider, that ſo long as I liued, I was a ſtay vnto her, and vnto the things that concerned her; but now her chiefe hope next vnto God conſiſteth in you. Therefore I pray you looke well vnto the things that appertaine vnto her: ſee that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing goe to wrecke, waſte and decay. Prouide that through your diligence her things may rather encreaſe than decreaſe. Ye know I hope the dutie of a good ſeruant, notwithſtanding at this my departure from you, I will put you in remembrance of it, that when I am gone, ye may yet remember my admonitions, and ſo the more ſpeedily aunſwer vnto your vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.<note place="margin">Eph 6. Col. 3. 1. Tim. 6. Tit. 2. 1.

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:184271:170"/>
to honour them, gently to aunſwere them, not to picke or ſteale away their goods, but to be faithfull vnto them in all things. See rhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that yee on this manner behaue your ſelues toward your miſtreſſe auoide all ſtubbornneſſe, churliſhnes, curſed ſpeakings, telling of tales, lying, picking, waſt, idlenes, negligence and ſluggiſhnes, eſchew all euill and riotous company. Fly drunkennes and whoredome. Abſtaine from vaine oathes and fooliſh paſtimes. So behaue your ſelues in all your life and conuerſation, that the name of God and his doctrine be not ill ſpoken of. Let the light of your godly behauiour ſo ſhine before men, that ye may doe worſhip to the glorious Goſpell of our Sauiour Chriſt in all things. And in this ſeruing your miſtreſſe with a glad, ready and faithfull will, thinke your ſelues to ſerue the Lord your God, and to doe that thing which is pleaſing in his fight, and that he alſo will ſee your paines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced,<note place="margin">Col. 4.</note> as the holy Apoſtle faith, Ye ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants be obedient vnto them that are your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily maiſters in all things, not with the eye ſeruice as men pleaſers, but in ſinglenes of heart fearing God. And whatſoeuer you doe, doe it hartily, as though ye did it to the Lord, and not vnto men, knowing that of the Lord ye ſhall receiue the rewarde of inheritance, for ye ſerue the Lord Chriſt. But he that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:184271:170"/>
ſhall receiue according to his ſinne. For there is no reſpect of perſons with God. If ye ſerue your miſtreſſe truly and faithfully, heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when ye your ſelues ſhal be houſeholders God ſhall likewiſe ſend you true and faithfull ſeruants.

For how euer death be the laſt ende of this life yet it is not the leaſt thing to be regarded in this life, (as before you haue ſignified.) My requeſt now therefore is to know how the ſicke man in the agony of death is to behaue himſelfe: for no doubt he

                  <hi>as it is in heauen.</hi> Why therefore ſhould he be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to haue that thing chance vnto him, for which hee dailie praies? <hi>That were but a

drawing neere vnto God with his lippes, and a diſhonouring of him with his heart.</hi> And what were that but an aſſuring of his ſoule, that in time he ſhalbe deſpiſed &amp; abhorred of God? for thus the Lord himſelfe ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2.30</note> 
                  <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me ſhalbe deſpiſed.</hi> But to proceed: it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to die, for who euer liued, that hath not died? who doth now or ſhall heereafter liue, that ſhall not alſo taſte of death? why then ſhould he that is ſicke deſire to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and grow out of kind? One man is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bee rich, becauſe an other is rich, to haue wife and children, becauſe another hath ſo, to goe trimly apparelled, becauſe another doth ſo &amp;c. Why ſhould hee not alſo be willing to die, becauſe another doth ſo? In this there is greater neceſſitie, then in the others poſſibilitie, for euerie man cannot be rich, euery man cannot be braue and trim, euerie man cannot haue wife and children &amp;c. but certaine it is, that euery man muſt die, his aunceſters the moſt holy and perfit haue died; why ſhould he diſdaine to follow their ſteppes? Is hee better then Abraham, Iſaac and Iaakob, and the reſt of the Patriarkes, that hee ſhould not die? Is hee wiſer then Dauid and Salomon, and other of the kings, that hee ſhould heere vpon earth for euer liue? Is he holier then Aaron, and Eleazer,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:184271:181"/>
and other of the prieſts, that he ſhould eſcape Death? is he cunninger than Nathan, and Eſaie, and Ieremie, and other of the Prophets, that he ſhould not yeeld to nature? when as all theſe Kings, Prieſts, Prophets, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches are dead, why ſhould hee grieue and grudge to die? as by them hee is to learne, that once hee muſt dye; ſo by their example he is to gather, that neuer either wiſedome, or holines, or cunning can ſaue him from death. If death had been only caſt vpon him, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thereof might haue been thought ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the more vnrighteous and intolerable. But for ſo much as all the forenamed haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie taſted of death, and all other heereafter ſhall, there is no reaſon but he alſo ſhuld both willingly and patiently ſubmit himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for hee is heere no other, than they were and all are. A ſtranger and ſoiourner as all his fathers were, an aliaunt and Pilgrime as all his brethren are. Heere he hath no continuing citie, but he is to ſeeke one which is to come. Whiles he is heere at home in the body, he is abſent from the Lord. The daies of his Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage are both few and euil. Nature hath giuen him but an Inne to reſt in, not a place to dwell in, &amp; what ſhould a ſtraunger be vnwilling to depart hence, and go home? that is neither the part nor propertie of a ſtranger. A ſtranger as he delights to heare fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his country when he is

And with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is deſirous to be. As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eagles are, where the carcaſe is; ſo his affection is, where theſe are, why then ſhould he or any ſicke (who is no other than a ſtranger) be vnwilling to die, and lay downe his life? his father, his mother, his brethren, his kinred are all hence, and in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.<note place="margin">Matth. 6.9.

                  <hi>Oh immortall God, how is that pleaſant and ioyfull iourney to be wiſhed for, which being once done and paſt, there remaineth no ſorow, no care, no penſiuenes? ô that goodly and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt daie when it ſhall be my hap to leaue this filthy and troubleſome world: and come to their companies that inhabit the heauens.</hi>

I would vtterly refuſe it, neither would I by any meanes call the race that I haue runne, backe againe, that I might againe be young. For what pleaſure and commoditie hath this life? yea rather what diſpleaſure, incommodity, paine, trauell and trouble hath it not? but let it be graunted, that it hath pleaſures: certes yet hath it either ſaciety or meaſure. And na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this world hath giuen vs a place to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in for a while, but not to dwell and continue in for euer.</hi> What ſhould a Chriſtian ſay? to him ſhould death be much better, and leſſe bitter than to an heathen? Of him therefore ſhould death be better accepted than of any heathen. But it is a world to ſee the world, the heathen writers in their monuments call death a chaunging for a better life, a quiet ſleep, are-mouing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mortalitie to immortalitie, from trouble to quietnes; from the ſhadow of a life vnto a very perfit and vncounterfet life, from ſorrow to ioy, from euill to good, and hauen of reſt, a ſolace of the minde; and end of all euill and wickedneſſe, and a beginning of all true ioy, felicitie and pleaſure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were vnwilling to liue. The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an profeſſours acknowledge all this, and more too, and yet they are vnwilling to die. What muſt follow heereupon, but that they muſt therfore be their iudges. It is ſaid, that one once hauing read a little booke of Platoes touching
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:184271:184"/>
the immortalitie of the ſoule did therefore make a way himſelfe, being thereto incenſed by too great a loue to eternitie &amp; a better life. How much more ſhould he that hath read the whole booke of God touching the happie eſtate of ſoule and bodie after death, be willing well to welcome death when God doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and lay the ſame vpon him? 1. In Gods booke of life there are better reaſons found to perſwade by thereto, than in Platoes booke of the immoratlitie of the ſoules there are any to enforce the making away of a mans owne life. 2. God hath more authoritie ouer. the ſoule of man to recommaund it againe to himſelfe at his pleaſure; than man hath ouer his life, to deceiue himſelfe of it when he will. God is the firſt giuer, and therefore ſhould be the firſt receiuer. Man is the ſole recaller, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be the ſafe keeper. But not longer than the firſt doner is content he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy ſuch a gift. All good men haue euer deſired to depart with it, when God was purpoſed to recall it. And what ſhould not he that is ſicke doe the like? either his ſickneſſe hath made him good, or it ought to haue made him good. For ſickeneſſe is euer ſent for good, and Gods great mercy it is, that he warnes with ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ere euer he ſtrikes with death. If it hath made him good, why is hee vnwilling to lay downe his life, when God doth call for his
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:184271:184"/>
life? if it hath found him good, why would he longer detaine it life than he may? If it be to make him good, why doth he hinder the working of it? be he good, or hath he a minde to be good, it is not his part to be vnwilling to die. So farre from being vnwilling to die, haue ſundrie of the godlieſt wights (that euer were in the world) been, as earneſtly they haue longed, wiſhed, deſired and prayed for death.

               <p>Yes: but not that way, this way to be taken ſhould bee no griefe at all, giuen they were once, one day this way to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and what ſhould the feare of being once taken away from theſe things make him that is but a ſteward ouer them, vnwilling to die? his loue to theſe things ſhould not be ſo great, but that hee ſhould willinglie leaue them, alwaies hee cannot ſtay with them, a parting there muſt be from them, and rather he ſhould be thankfull vnto God, for the long
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:184271:194"/>
vſe he hath had of them, then vnwilling to die, becauſe of the loue he beares to them. It may be if he had liued longer they ſhould haue bin taken from him; &amp; what a griefe would that haue bin? of the twain, it is better for him to be taken from them, then the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be taken from him, by the firſt he is ſure he hath vſe of them during life; and ſo eſcapes the miſeries many others are ſubiect vnto which want them: by the laſt he ſhould haue beene ſure to haue beene filled with griefe conceiued vpon the loſſe and lacke of them: by the firſt hee is in poſſibilitie to diſpoſe of them to Gods glorie and others good: by the laſt he ſhould haue been at a certaintie, that he ſhould no waies haue beſtowed them, for man cannot diſpoſe of that he hath not. What therefore by death ſhould he be vnwilling to leaue them? It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to leaue them by death, then to looſe them by misfortune in life, in taking him from them when he can no longer ſtay with them, death doth him no hurt, but good. Firſt,<note place="margin">Gen. 47. Pſ. 39. 1. Pet. 2. Heb. 13.</note> it takes but him away, that cannot ſtay, the beſt in this world is but a pilgrime and ſtranger, he hath heere no dwelling Citie, but he lookes for an other that is to come, and what ſhould hee bee vnwilling to goe, that muſt of neceſſitie goe? It is better be times then too late, hee ſhal the ſooner come to his waies end, he ſhal haue the longer time of reſt when he comes,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:184271:195"/>
there he ſhall all the way goe in the leſſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill and the more ſafetie &amp;c. Secondly, it takes him but from thoſe things which will one day leaue him, though it were granted him many daies to ſtay with them, for though his houſes were neuer ſo ſtrong and ſtately, yet are they but earthlie &amp; tranſitory, as in time they were made of clay, ſo in time they wil turne to clay, how ſoone, and in what maner, neither he, nor any man elſe can tell. And what ſhould he be vnwilling to be taken from thoſe things which one day will he, nill he, will bee taken from him? It is better to leaue them, then to be left of them. The contempt of them makes a man rich, not his loue to them. Thirdly, it helpes him to more and better, then it takes him from, it takes him from earthlie; it helpes him to heauenlie; it takes him from corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it helpes him to incorruptible; it takes him from temporall, it helpes him to eternall, it takes him from ſomewhat that man made, it helps him to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which none but God made: and what ſhould he be vnwilling to change for the better? It is euer good changing for the beſt and for the beſt he is heere ſure (ſo he beleeues) for to change after this his earthlie houſe of this tabernacle be deſtroied he ſhall haue a building giuen of God,<note place="margin">2.

Firſt there are foure things which may make the houſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues blame worthie; or if not them, yet either their builders or inhabiters. 1. The matter of them, if they be made of things vniuſtlie got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,<note place="margin">Ier. 22.13.</note> for ſaith Ieremie. <hi>Woe vnto him that buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his houſe by vnrighteouſnes, and his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers without equitie.</hi> 2. The forme, if they bee too great, too coſtlie, too full of pleaſure and delight, for againe ſaith Ieremie. <hi>Woe vnto him that ſaith, I will build me a wide houſe, and large chambers,</hi> (and here is the greatnes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,) <hi>ſo he will make himſelfe large win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes</hi> (and here is the pleaſure therof and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light therein diſproued) <hi>and ſeeling with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi> (and here is the coſtlines diſalowed) <hi>and paint them with vermilion.</hi> 3. The varietie, if they bee too many, moe by many that are meete and neceſſarie, for ſaith Eſaie: <hi>Woe vnto
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:184271:197"/>
them that ioyne houſe vnto houſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 5.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and lay field to field till there be no place that ye may be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by your ſelues in the middest of the earth:</hi> and immediatelie after, this is in mine eares ſaith the Lord of hoſtes: ſurely many houſes ſhall be deſolate, euen great and faire, without inhabitants. 4. the euill intent, if they be made more to ſhew vanitie, than to ſerue neceſſitie: for as Seneca ſaith, an houſe is a muniment and defence againſt thoſe things which are hurtfull to the bodie: this whether an hedge or a wall doth vphold it, it little skils. Know yee this, men are as well couered with gale as with golde. Contemne ye the reſt, which ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labour makes as an ornament: remember yee that there is nothing merueilous but the ſoule, to which being great, there is nothing great. 2. There are fiue or ſixe things which may or ſhould draw the founders of them, and dwellers in them, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo much loue vnto them, as ſhould make thee vnwilling to depart from them. 2. The curſe that is denounced againſt thoſe that loue them, Eſa. 5.8. and Iere. 22.13. 2. The hatred y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God beareth againſt the houſes that are ſo loued, Amos 6.8. <hi>The Lord God hath ſworne by himſelfe, ſaith the Lord God of hostes, I abhor the excellencie of Iacob, and hate his palaces:</hi> 3. The examples of ſundry good ones whoſe ſteps we ſhould follow, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much loued them, nor any thing eſteemed
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:184271:198"/>
them. In his birth our Sauiour Chriſt for his houſe had but an Inne, Luk. 2.7. and at his death a tombe, Matth. 27.60. all his life he had not where to reſt his head, Matth. 8.20. For A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham the father of the faithfull;<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> the Apoſtle ſaith, Heb. 11.9. <hi>By faith he abode in the land of promiſe, as in a ſtrange countrey, as one that dwelt in the tents with Iſaac and Iacob, heires with him of the ſame promiſe: for he looked for a citie, hauing a foundation, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi> For others he ſaith, Heb. 11.37, 38. <hi>They wandred vp and downe in ſheepes skins, and in goates skins, being destitute, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and tormented: whom the world was not worthy of: they wandred in wilderneſſes and mountaines, and dens, and caues of the earth,</hi> (great, faire, coſtly, and ſumptuous buildings, ſtrong, ſtout, and ſtately habitations, huge, high, and honourable houſes) for ſome one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amongſt many. It is reported of him, that he had his houſe in the maner of his ſepulchre. And when the Emperour that then was asked him, why he fitted his houſe to his body, hee anſwered him, this is ſufficient for a man that muſt dye, and thereto he added: It is better leapt into heauen out of a cottage than out of a pallace. 4. The iniurie that is offered others in the making of them. For there often the builders lay, which at will they ſhould haue giuen to the poore, and therefore Paul of whom Hierome writes, would not lay out his
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:184271:198"/>
money vpon ſuch ſtones as ſhould periſh with the world but vpon liuing ſtones which are tumbled vpon the ground, and of which the citie of the great king is builded. 5. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation that the ſtones often in ſuch houſes make vnto God againſt thoſe that there layde them, and being layde, too to much loued and eſteemed them: for as the Prophet Habakuk ſaith, Hab. 2.11. <hi>The ſtone ſhall crie out of the wall, and the beame out of the timber ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it.</hi> 12. <hi>Woe vnto him that buildeth a towne with blood, and erecteth a citie by iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> 6. The follie that is ſhewed in building of fine houſes, and committed in louing them when they are builded. For firſt mens liues are ſhorter now than euer they were, and yet now they muſt haue brauer houſes than euer they had, and what wiſe man thinkes not that a follie: Secondly, mens ſoules are as pretious now as euer they were, yet now they will haue better houſes for their bodies than for them, and what religious man knowes not that a follie? The care for the ſoule, ſhould not be leſſe than the care for the bodie: he that ſaith for the bodie, <hi>Care not for the bodie,</hi> ſaith for the ſoule; <hi>Keepe thy ſoule diligently,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 6.25 Deut. 4.9.</note> and he that will be worſhipped in Spirit, becauſe he is a ſpirit, wil be glorified with the body, becauſe the ſpirit remaines in the bodie, as the Apoſtle therefore ſaith in one place:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.13</note> 
                  <hi>The bodie is not
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:184271:199"/>
for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the bodie:</hi> So againe hee ſaith in another, <hi>Therefore glorifie God in your bodie and in your ſpirit: for they are Gods.</hi> And betweene both: <hi>Knowe yee not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid:</hi> and againe, <hi>Know ye not that your bodie is the temple of the holy Ghost, which is in you, whom ye haue of God? And ye are not your owne.</hi> Thirdly, the Apoſtle ſaith:<note place="margin">Col. 3.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Set your affections on things which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and not on things which are on the earth,</hi> yet now they haue ſuch loue to their houſes, as for their houſes they are loath to goe to God, loath to yeelde to nature, vnwilling to goe the way of all earth, and what good man deemes not this a folly? Howſoeuer men loue their houſes here, yet for loue of them they ſhould not bee careles of the houſes, they ſhould ſeeke otherwhere.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.2.</note> 
                  <hi>We ſigh</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>deſiring to be cloathed with our houſe, which is from heauen,</hi> and they ſigh, becauſe they muſt forgoe their houſe which they haue on earth; and yet the Apoſtle by his ſpeech ſheweth what houſe their loue ſhould bee moſt to, their houſe from heauen; their houſe eternall in the heauens. How much ſoeuer they loue their houſes, yet will not their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes here continue, neither ſhall they euer get
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:184271:199"/>
any thing by the loue they beare them. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their houſes ſhall and will decay: the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Ieruſalem was a fine houſe, a finer houſe I gueſſe, than the fineſt they haue, yet as fine as it was,<note place="margin">Matt. 24.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Ieſus ſaid of it when his Diſciples ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the building of it, there ſhall not be left a ſtone vpon a ſtone, which ſhall not bee cast downe.</hi> If that might not ſtand which was built at Gods appoyntment, and for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, they may well thinke theirs ſhall not, which are built at their owne aſſignement, and for their owne pleaſure and delight: theirs haue no ſuch priuiledges as that had.

Hierome recites this as one, that all buildings ſhall fall and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theirs too, becauſe els al ſhal not, for none is exempted where all are expreſſed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though they ſhould or could ſtand, yet they
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:184271:200"/>
ſhould get nothing by their loue towardes them. For our Sauiour Chriſt ſayth, <hi>Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhall forſake houſes or lands for my name ſake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 19.29</note> 
                  <hi>hee ſhall receiue an hundreth fold more, and ſhall inherite euerlaſting life.</hi> And thence it may bee collected, that whoſoeuer ſhall make more account of houſes, or lands, than of the name of Chriſt, hee ſhall here looſe of that hee hath, and in the ende miſſe of eternall life too: And then what ſhall they gette? By this Iudge you now which haue heard me all this while, whether it is good that a man that muſt die, ſhould be vnwilling to die becauſe of his fine houſe, from which Death when ſhe comes doth take him?</p>

                  <hi>Reioyce with them that reioyce, and weepe with them that weepe: be of like affection one towards another.</hi> My concluſion therefore is as before, that when as there will no ſuch friends be found (as will be ſicke when their friend is ſicke, or die when their friend doth

die, there ſhould none that is ſicke be vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to die becauſe of his friends. Firſt, he hath knowen the good his friendes can doe him. Secondly, he is not ignorant what he himſelfe can doe for them. Thirdly, he ſhall leaue them to one that may and can, and peraduenture will doe more for them then euer he was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, though many yeeres more hee ſhould haue liued. Fourthly, he is vncertaine whether his friend would continue if he ſhould liue. Many change ſoone, and ſome doe what they minde to doe very ſodenly, when they haue done, what they can for him, and he what he could for them, what ſhould hee ſtay vpon them? It may bee the longer his ſtay is with them, the worſer it would be for him. Friends often cauſe men to doe amiſſe, and ſometime men ſuſtein more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer they ſhould, had it not bin for their frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, ſomtime they come to pouerty by their frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, ſomtime they receiue puniſhment for their friends, ſometime they reape ſhame through their friends.

               <p>Departing then from his friendes here, in the faith and feare of God, doubt you not but he ſhall goe to better other where.

After his departure hence (ſo he then and his friendes afterwardes, depart in the faith of Chriſt) he ſhall ſee thoſe his friendes againe from whom he departes here, and that in farre better ſort and caſe, then euer heere he either did or could ſee them, for hee ſaw them cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, but there he ſhall ſee them incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible; here he ſaw them mortall, here he ſaw them miſerable and inglorious, but there he ſhall ſee them all bleſſed and glorious.

And therefore the departed out of this life ſhall know one another after this life. For why? their knowledge in heauen ſhall not be infetiour to Adams knowledge in paradiſe. But their eſtate ſhall be much more bleſſed and perfect. For Adam in his beſt eſtate had poſſibilitie to fall, but they in theirs ſhall haue neither power nor will. Out of the .84.

Out of the Goſpell according to Saint Luke,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> it doth thus appeare: if there bee mutuall knowledge after this life, betweene the good and euill, there is much more ſo betweene the good themſelues, for they are all Citizens in one citie, fellow heires of one kingdome, members of one body, fellow ſeruants in one houſeholde ſeruing one Lord and God, and they we all know well, know one another: but there is mutuall knowledge after this life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the good and euill.

                  <note place="margin">Luk. 16.23.</note> 
                  <hi>did know both Abraham and Lazarus being in ioy: and Abraham againe (though he were long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rich man) did know that miſerable and vnmercifull rich man (though hee were much after Abraham) for as the rich man ſeeing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham a farre of, and Lazarus in his boſome, cryed, ſaying, Father Abraham haue mercie on me, and ſend Lazarus that he may dippe the tippe of his finger in water, and coole my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame: ſo Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham hearing the rich man crying, anſwered and ſayd: Sonne remember that thou in thy life time receiuedst thy pleaſure, and likewiſe Lazarus paines; now therefore hee is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and thou art tormented.</hi> Therefore there is mutuall knowledge much more after this life, betweene the good themſelues: for neerer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and much more conuerſant one with

Heauen and hell are much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant one from another: the one is aboue, the other is beneath. <hi>Betweene both there is a great gulfe ſet, ſo that they which would goe from heauen to hell, cannot; neither can they which are in hell goe from thence to heauen.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they which are in hell, doe both ſee and knowe them that are in heauen, and they which are in heauen, knowe them alſo which are in hell; much more doe they which are in heauen, knowe thoſe that are with them in heauen. For it is eaſier to knowe them that are of the ſame houſe and familie with them, with whome they are daylie conuerſant, than thoſe which are of another, and with whome they ſeldome or neuer meete. Conuerſing one with another, is a ready way to the knowing one of another. But to proceede, out of Paules epiſtles to the Romanes, it doth thus appeare: the members of one and the ſame bodie know one another: for the head know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hand, and the hand the head; the eye knoweth the foote, and the foote the eye, the eare knoweth the tongue, and the tongue knoweth others, and the heart knoweth all. But all the godly departed, are members of one and the ſame bodie: for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We being many,</hi>

                  <hi>There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thing in Gods elect and choſen people, which is to bee marueiled at, for they being in heauen, doe not onelie know them whom they knew in this world, but they know alſo the good people whom they neuer ſaw, euen as perfectly as though they had afore both ſeene and knowne them, for when they in that euerlaſting inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhall ſee the auncient Fathers, they ſhall not be vnknowne to them in ſight, whom they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies knew in worke: for when they all with a like cleanneſſe doe behold God, what is it that they ſhould not there know, where they know him that knoweth all thinges?</hi> The next out of whom I will alledge any thing is Brandmiller a Miniſter and citizen of Baſil,<note place="margin">Brandmil. conc. funer.

ſhall know thoſe, with whom in this life wee haue beene conuerſant, our parents, our children, our kinred and acquaintance, yea and alſo all the Patriarches and Prophets; Adam, Abraham, Moſes, Dauid, Eſaie, Iohn the Baptist, Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Elizabeth, Marie the mother of our Lord Christ, Peter, Paul and others as the Apoſtles in mount Thabor both ſaw and knew Moſes and Elias, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they there talked with Chriſt, though they themſelues ſtill were but in their mortall and corruptible bodies, For in the life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting we ſhall not be ſtockes wanting all ſence and vnderſtanding as ſome affirme, which ſay that after this life we ſhall not one mutuallie know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.

If further manifeſtation thereof bee required, more is yet at hand to be adioyned, many of the better ſort among the heathens were ſo well beaten to the beliefe thereof, as they not onely thereupon hartilie deſired death ere it came, but alſo tooke it ioyfully and patiently when it came, they deſired it, that ſo they might goe the ſooner vnto the bleſſed company of immortall Gods: they quietlie and ioyfullie ſuffered it, that ſo much the more certainlie they might ſee and know, not onelie the gods, but alſo all thoſe noble, good and vertuous perſons that euer liued in this world, aſwell ſuch as they neuer knew, as

               <p>Alas, alas, by either of thoſe ſayinges the doctrine before deliuered is nothing at all croſſed or diſproued. For firſt, the dead know nothing at al as they are dead, yet it followeth not therefore, but that they know ſomething as they liue. Secondly, in the graue (where the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:184271:225"/>
bodie muſt lie when it is dead) there is no knowledge, yet it thereupon followes not, that in heauen (where the ſoule doth liue) there is no knowledge. Moreouer the dead know nothing at all, as they are dead, ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as they are dead: but ſhall they therefore know nothing when they ſhall liue againe? they know nothing in the bodie, ſo long as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is in the graue, and ſhall they therefore know nothing in the bodie, when the body is raiſed vp out of the graue? they know nothing in the bodie betweene the day of their death, and the day of doome; and ſhall they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know nothing at all after the generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? or do they therfore now in the ſoule know nothing betweene the day of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and the generall day of reſtauration? there is a <hi>non ſequitur</hi> in all theſe: ſo is there alſo in that which ſhould be concluded out of the places obiected, for they ſpeake of the dead, as they are dead; they ſpeake of the the dead while they are dead; they ſpeak nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the dead as they doe liue, nor as they ſhall liue. And the doctrine before deliuered ſpeakes wholly of the dead as they ſhal liue in ſoule, in the time preſent; and as they ſhal liue in bodie &amp; ſoule in the time to come.

by God; who doth diſpoſe of all things better than euer he could purpoſe or imagine. And he that hath ſo many good purpoſes in his head and his heart, why doth he not diſpatch them out of the way, ere euer death come? It is no time then to bethinke himſelfe of them. Death will not tarie either his or their leaſure: any wiſe man will thinke it were good looking to them afore hand. Salomon ſaith, <hi>All that thine hand ſhall finde to doe,</hi>

For out of his thoughts comes his purpoſes. Firſt he thinkes, then he purpoſes. If he hopes that God will deferte his death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his purpoſes, he wil ſurely be deceiued. The purpoſes of man cannot diſappoint the purpoſe of God. If they might, men would be full of good purpoſes, that they might liue long. But ſo God hath ordeyned, that many are taken away in the midſt of their good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, to teach the reſt to be as quicke in fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, as in purpoſing.

               <p>Alacke, alacke: that the miſſing of theſe things ſhould make any man vnwilling to die, heere is nothing of any ſuch waight. 1. his wife is vnprouided for. What then? muſt he therefore be vnwilling to die? 1. he might haue prouided for her aforetime he had time enough, if he had had a minde thereto. 2. is he ſure ſhe ſhould haue beene prouided for if he had liued. Many the longer they liue, the more they ſpend: and the leſſe they haue in the end to leaue behinde them. Many againe, looſe more in an houre than they get in a yeare. What he might or ſhould doe is altogither vnknowen, and to him very vncertaine. 3. his wife may be better prouided for than he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of. 1. God himſelfe hath promiſed to be an husband to the widow. And as I thinke he both can and will then better prouide for her than euer he either would or could. I am ſure he hath prouided wel for many after their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands death, that neuer were well prouided for in their liues, you your ſelfe can produce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples enough, I neede not propound any yet that by them you may thinke of others, you may call to minde, Ruth the Moabiteſſe the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:184271:229"/>
wife of Mahton, the widow of Zarephath,<note place="margin">Ruth. 4.10. 1. King. 17. 2. King. 4.1.</note> and one of the wiues of the ſonnes of the Prophets. 2. his wife may marrie againe to another after his death that will be as carefull for her as euer he was in his life. The ſecond marriages are not euer the moſt ſecond. Many ſpeed better at the laſt, than at the firſt. The Roman princes and captaines haue married widowes; and the moſt holy king, Dauid, tooke two widowes to wife, which both had been the wiues of his inferiours. The one was Bathſheba the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Eliam, wife to Vriah the Hittite,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 11.3</note> the other Abigail the wife of Nabal the carmelite. What may betide his he knoweth not. It may be a better than himſelf may ioyne with her. What then for her cauſe ſhould he be vnwilling to die? let him leaue the prouiding for her, either to him that ſhall next enioy her, if ſhe marries againe, or to God himſelfe, if ſhe keepes her ſelfe a widowe the one or the other, or both of theſe will ſo ſufficiently prouide for her, as he needs not any thing to beate his head about her. But. 2. (and ſecondly to) his children are vnprouided for what then? ſhall he therefore grieue and grudge to die? did neuer any man leaue his children vnprouided for but he? or ſhall they neuer be prouided for, becauſe they are not prouided for, becauſe they are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for by him? or is he ſure they ſhall be prouided for, if he doth what in him lyeth to
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:184271:230"/>
prouide for them? many haue left their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vnprouided for, becauſe they had not any thing to giue them; and yet they haue done well enough. Many againe haue left them much becauſe they had enough, and yet they in ſhort time haue come to nothing: it is neither the fathers prouiding for them, nor the fathers, nor prouiding that doth anything, but the bleſſing of God that doth all in all. If he bleſſes, though the father doth nothing, the children ſhall do well enough, his bleſſing will make them rich. If he curſes though the father giues much, the children wil come to nothing. His curſing will make them poore what may, ſhall, or wil betide them he is vtterly ignorant. It may be a better ſtepfather may ſtep vp in his place, than he euer would or could haue been a naturall father. I my ſelfe haue knowne ſome that haue come to more by their ſteede fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than euer they could by their owne father what then for their cauſe ſhould he be vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die? let him leaue the prouiding for them, either to him that ſhall be their ſtepfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if euer God moue the minde of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to marrie againe, or elſe to him that hath promiſed to be a ſtedfather to the poſteritie of thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> loue him. The one or the other, or both of theſe wil ſo ſufficiently prouide for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he needs not any thing to trouble his mind about them. If they be good, God himſelfe will take
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:184271:230"/>
better care and charge of them, then euer he himſelfe did, for he wil neuer leaue them, nor let them be fatherles, he will nouriſh them, &amp; teach them from their youth vp; vntill their olde age, death and graue, hee wil not forſake them. So will he prouide for them, as wel they may ſay and ſing with Dauid: my Father and my mother forſooke mee, but the Lord hath taken me vp. If they be euill, what ſhould hee ſo much care for them as he ſhould be vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to depart the world by reaſon of them? rather let him leaue them to the world, to bee corrected by the worlde, then prouide for them in the world, that yee may haue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to follow the faſhions of the world, by caring for them hee doth but foſter the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes that is in them, and what ſhould hee care to cheriſh that which will grow too faſt of it ſelfe? wee weede the thiſtles out of our corne, wee cut the nettles out of our gardens, we rend the Iuie from our Oakes:<note place="margin">1.

The further hee goes, the ſimpler hee is, did he know or conſider what it is to be with Chriſt in heauen, he would neuer be deſirous for a graue to ſtay from him here on earth.

the earth ſwallowed vp, ſerpents deſtroyed, dogges ſpoyled, and the ſworde made away. Theſe all, and many moe wanted that which hee is ſo deſirous to haue: and yet I hope a number of them were neuer the worſe for that: neither I warrant him ſhall any bee that liues in the feare of God, and dyes in his faith: it is not a ſtately tombe or a coſtly ſepulture that betters any: as good haue wanted both theſe, as haue enioyed either.

As a man takes better the death of his friend which lay long ſicke, than of him which died ſodeinly: ſo doth he take his own death more willingly, that hath been often thought of, than that with which he is ſodeinly ouertaken.

For this mortifying of the deedes of the fleſh
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:184271:242"/>
by the operation of the ſpirit, is a readie way to make vs willing to die, and vnwilling to liue. But the cockring of the fleſh, and the giuing our ſelues to delight, is that which makes vs altogether vnwilling to leaue this preſent world, and wholly deſirous euer to remaine and abide in the ſame. For this we finde by proofe, that no man is more vnwilling to die, than he that deſires to followe the delights of the world, and to fulfill the luſtes of the fleſh. If therefore any man would be willing to die, he ſees what is one point of his dutie, by one part of the aduiſe I giue him. More he may ſee, by farther aduiſe to bee giuen him. But my meaning is not to burthen him with precepts: all that I will further ſay, is this, that I would perſwade him to recal into his minde ſome of thoſe good leſſons which all his life long, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he himſelfe hath read, or elſe heard, either read or preached by others. For the time of ſickenes is the time wherein a man is to make vſe of al the good things he hath learned al his life long.

               <p>Yes it is like that he will take it. But it is vncertaine whether he will take it into his owne hands, to preſerue and keepe it, or giue it in to the Diuels hands, to plague and puniſh it. It may be for his negligence in not doing it, the Lord will ſo take it, as nothing but ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance ſhall light vpon it. It is good euer to preuent the worſt. The Diuell lieth alway in wait to deuour, but neuer is he ſo greedy as them. For then he knowes, that what he gets, he for euer gets, as then he for euer looſes, what then he looſes.</p>

The olde man ſaith not, I did beleeue in God; neither doth the young man ſay, I wil beleeue in God: but both ſay, I doe beleeue in God. And wherefore is this, but to teach that a man muſt beleeue in God, as well when he is young, as when he is olde?

As it was a fault in Felix to ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paul, I will heare thee when I haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient time: ſo it is in him that would bee Felix, to ſay vnto God, I will beleeue in thee; I will obeye thee, when I haue a conuenient time.

Hee looked that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould anſwere him, Yea Lorde I loue thee: ſo when hee asketh any this queſtion, Beleeueſt thou in mee? Hee looketh that hee ſhould anſwere him, Yea Lord, I doe beleeue in thee. He liketh not, I will beleeue in thee.
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:184271:249"/>
There is ſome certaintie, in I doe beleeue in thee; but there is great doubt, in I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in thee. He that doth not beleeue, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine whether euer hee ſhall beleeue. It is not in his owne power to beleeue when he liſt to beleeue: neither if it were, is hee ſure that God will then like of his beleeuing, which would not other when beleeue, when it was meete he ſhould haue beleeued.</p>

               <p>I, but it is a true ſaying, Repentance can neuer bee to ſoone. The firſt leſſon that Iohn taught was,<note place="margin">Matt. 3.2.10</note> 
                  <hi>Repent, for the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at hand.</hi> The firſt leſſon that the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples taught was,<note place="margin">Matth. 4.10</note> 
                  <hi>Repent too, for the kingdome of heauen is at hand.</hi> And the firſt leſſon that Chriſt taught was, <hi>Repent alſo, for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen is at hand.</hi> And all this was for no other cauſe, but to teach all, that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhould bee the firſt worke any man ſhould doe. And now if this bee ſo; then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faith nor obedience muſt be the laſt that muſt bee looked after. For repentance is not full, till faith and obedience comes; the firſt to aſſure of pardon for the ſinnes paſt, the ſecond, to preuent through grace, all ſinnes that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would come. As a man therefore in the beginning of his age, is to repent, that he may attaine to the kingdome of heauen, ſo is hee
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:184271:249"/>
alſo to beleeue and obey, timely crookes the tree that true cramhooke will be, and timely turnes the man that true Chriſtian wil prooue. The tree which buddeth not in ſpring is dead all the yeare, the man which beleeueth not in youth, is moſt what vnbeleeuing in age. If children be deformed in youth, there is ſmall likely good they will be well fauoured in age. So if mens minds be planted in ſinne while they are young, ſeldome any goodnes buds thereout when they are olde. As other grafts, ſo vertue muſt haue a time to grow. The ſeede thereof is ſowen in youth, but the fruite cometh vp in age. As the beſt killing of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent is in the egge, ſo the beſt maſtring of ſin is in the youth. If it be not then ouercome, it will hardly be ouercome. It is hard making of an old dogge to ſtoope. If he be not taught while he is a whelpe, he will be vnskilfull, ſo if man be not reformed while he is young, he will be wicked when he is olde. What man in youth doth moſt put in vre, that til death to keepe he ſhall be ſure. As the arrow is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected at the firſt, ſo it flieth all the way, ouer or vnder or beſide, but it neuer findeth the marke vnles it be leuelled right in the hand. So as the life of man is begunne, ſo it is moſt what continued, either wide, ſhort or gon of, and from that it ſhould be. The beginning is halfe of the whole. Of a good beginning ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:184271:250"/>
comes a bad ende. If therefore a man will be in hope of a good death, it is good for him betimes to ſette vpon a good life. A good life is a good meanes to a good death; and the ſooner that that is begunne, the better this in the ende will be. Ye wiſh (ſaith Petrarch) to die well, but that your wiſhing is in vaine except ye haue liued well, as if without liuing well there were no dying well.</p>
